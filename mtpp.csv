,,,,1,The relationship between contact and attitudes: Reducing prejudice toward individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities,"Jessica M. Keith, Loisa Bennetto , Ronald D. Rogge",Research in Developmental Disabilities,September,December 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422215001183,"Increases in intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) diagnoses coupled with higher rates of inclusion in school and community settings, has created more opportunities for exposure and integration between those with IDD and the mainstream population. Previous research has found that increased contact can lead to more positive attitudes toward those with IDD. The current study further investigated this impact of contact on attitudes by examining the influence of the quality and quantity of contact on both explicit and implicit levels of prejudice, while also considering potential mediation via intergroup anxiety and implicit attitudes. Based on past research and theory, we predicted that contact (especially quality contact) would have a strong relationship with explicit and implicit positive attitudes toward individuals with IDD. In the present study, 550 people completed a survey and short task that measured their level of contact with individuals with IDD across their lifetime, their current attitudes toward these individuals, and other constructs that are thought to influence this relationship. Multiple regression analyses suggested consistent links between higher quality of contact and lower levels of prejudice toward individuals with IDD at both the explicit and implicit levels. After controlling for quality of contact, higher quantity of contact was either not significantly associated with our measures of prejudice or was, importantly, associated with higher levels of prejudice. Additional analyses support intergroup anxiety and implicit positive attitudes as significant mediators in the associations between quality of contact and the various dimensions of explicit prejudice. Thus, it would seem that it is the quality of interpersonal interactions that is most strongly related to positive attitudes toward individuals with IDD, making it crucial to take care when developing inclusion opportunities in community settings.",
,,,,2,Ordered questions bias eyewitnesses and jurors,"Robert B. Michael, , Maryanne Garry",Psychonomic Bulletin & Review,September,September 2015,http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0933-1,"Eyewitnesses play an important role in the justice system. But suggestive questioning can distort eyewitness memory and confidence, and these distorted beliefs influence jurors (Loftus, Learning & Memory, 12, 361–366, 2005; Penrod & Culter, Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 1, 817–845,1995). Recent research, however, hints that suggestion is not necessary: Simply changing the order of a set of trivia questions altered people’s beliefs about their accuracy on those questions (Weinstein & Roediger, Memory & Cognition, 38, 366–376, 2010, Memory & Cognition, 40, 727–735,2012). We wondered to what degree eyewitnesses' beliefs—and in turn the jurors who evaluate them—would be affected by this simple change to the order in which they answer questions. Across six experiments, we show that the order of questions matters. Eyewitnesses reported higher accuracy and were more confident about their memory when questions seemed initially easy, than when they seemed initially difficult. Moreover, jurors’ beliefs about eyewitnesses closely matched those of the eyewitnesses themselves. These findings have implications for eyewitness metacognition and for eyewitness questioning procedures.",
,,,,3,Editorial Bias in Crowd-Sourced Political Information,"Joshua L. Kalla, Peter M. Aronow,",PLOS one,September,September 2015,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136327,"The Internet has dramatically expanded citizens’ access to and ability to engage with political information. On many websites, any user can contribute and edit “crowd-sourced” information about important political figures. One of the most prominent examples of crowd-sourced information on the Internet is Wikipedia, a free and open encyclopedia created and edited entirely by users, and one of the world’s most accessed websites. While previous studies of crowd-sourced information platforms have found them to be accurate, few have considered biases in what kinds of information are included. We report the results of four randomized field experiments that sought to explore what biases exist in the political articles of this collaborative website. By randomly assigning factually true but either positive or negative and cited or uncited information to the Wikipedia pages of U.S. senators, we uncover substantial evidence of an editorial bias toward positivity on Wikipedia: Negative facts are 36% more likely to be removed by Wikipedia editors than positive facts within 12 hours and 29% more likely within 3 days. Although citations substantially increase an edit’s survival time, the editorial bias toward positivity is not eliminated by inclusion of a citation. We replicate this study on the Wikipedia pages of deceased as well as recently retired but living senators and find no evidence of an editorial bias in either. Our results demonstrate that crowd-sourced information is subject to an editorial bias that favors the politically active.",
Technology,,,,4,Visual Dynamics: Probabilistic Future Frame Synthesis via Cross Convolutional Networks,"T Xue, J Wu, KL Bouman, WT Freeman",arXiv,July,July 2016,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.02586.pdf,"We study the problem of synthesizing a number of likely future frames from a single input image. In contrast to traditional methods, which have tackled this problem in a deterministic or non-parametric way, we propose a novel approach that models future frames in a probabilistic manner. Our probabilistic model makes it possible for us to sample and synthesize many possible future frames from a single input image. Future frame synthesis is challenging, as it involves low- and high-level image and motion understanding. We propose a novel network structure, namely a Cross Convolutional Network to aid in synthesizing future frames; this network structure encodes image and motion information as feature maps and convolutional kernels, respectively. In experiments, our model performs well on synthetic data, such as 2D shapes and animated game sprites, as well as on realwold videos. We also show that our model can be applied to tasks such as visual analogy-making, and present an analysis of the learned network representations.",
Technology,,,,5,Style-based exploration of illustration datasets,"E Garces, A Agarwala, A Hertzmann, D Gutierrez",Multimedia Tools and Applications,July,July 2016,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-016-3702-x,"Searching by style in illustration data sets is a particular problem in Information Retrieval which has received little attention so far. One of its main problems is that the perception of style is highly subjective, which makes labeling styles a very difficult task. Despite being difficult to predict computationally, certain properties such as colorfulness, line style or shading can be successfully captured by existing style metrics. However, there is little knowledge about how we distinguish between different styles and how these metrics can be used to guide users in style-based interactions. In this paper, we propose several contributions towards a better comprehension of illustration style and its usefulness for data exploration and retrieval. First, we provide new insights about how we perceive style in illustration. Second, we evaluate a handmade style clustering of clip art pieces with an existing style metric to analyze how this metric aligns with expert knowledge. Finally, we propose a method for efficient navigation and exploration of large clip art data sets which takes into account both semantic labeling of the data and its style. Our approach combines hierarchical clustering with dimensionality reduction techniques, and strategic sampling to obtain intuitive visualizations and useful visualizations.",
Psych,,,,6,Gender stereotypes and intellectual performance: Stigma consciousness as a buffer against stereotype validation,"JK Clark, KC Thiem, AE Hoover, MM Habashi",Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,July,July 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116300890,"Previous research has found that activating self-relevant, negative stereotypes after a task may increase people's certainty about their own poor performance (i.e., stereotype validation). The current research examined how individual differences in stigma consciousness may moderate these effects. Building from past findings, we hypothesized that high stigma consciousness in women would be associated with lower susceptibility to gender stereotype validation—due to heightened motivation to avoid, reject, and/or react against perceived bias. In two studies, participants completed a difficult test on the subject of business economics. When the gender stereotype about business ability was made salient afterward, no evidence of stereotype validation emerged among women high in stigma consciousness. However, for women with lower stigma consciousness, the data suggest that stereotype activation validated negative views of their own performance and, in turn, had an adverse effect on related attitudes and beliefs about their abilities.",
Psych,,,,7,Does (Non‐) Meaningful Sensori‐Motor Engagement Promote Learning With Animated Physical Systems?,"WTJL Pouw, C Eielts, T Gog, RA Zwaan, F Paas","Mind, Brain, and Education",July,July 2016,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mbe.12105/abstract;jsessionid=290AD81CC99A46F83B5980BCFC78CCBA.f01t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=,"Previous research indicates that sensori-motor experience with physical systems can have a positive effect on learning. However, it is not clear whether this effect is caused by mere bodily engagement or the intrinsically meaningful information that such interaction affords in performing the learning task. We investigated (N = 74), through the use of a Wii Balance Board, whether different forms of physical engagement that was either meaningfully, non-meaningfully, or minimally related to the learning content would be beneficial (or detrimental) to learning about the workings of seesaws from instructional animations. The results were inconclusive, indicating that motoric competency on lever problem solving did not significantly differ between conditions, nor were response speed and transfer performance affected. These findings suggest that adult's implicit and explicit knowledge about physical systems is stable and not easily affected by (contradictory) sensori-motor experiences. Implications for embodied learning are discussed.",
Psych,,,,8,"Health goals among American adults: Prevalence, characteristics, and barriers","M Milyavskaya, D Nadolny",Journal of Health Psychology,July,July 2016,http://hpq.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/08/1359105316656227.abstract,"Although numerous factors have been demonstrated in laboratory settings to lead to more successful health goal attainment, their actual use in daily goal pursuit is unknown. This study examines spontaneously reported health goals and their characteristics in a sample of 557 American adults. Participants responded to questions about health and health goals, with items assessing motivation, social support, and implementation intentions. In all, 66 percent of respondents had a health goal, 26 percent of participants had implementation intentions, and 47 percent received support from close others. Results suggest that interventions should focus on encouraging goal setting, teaching implementation intentions, and educating close others in providing support.",
Politics,,,,9,"Beliefs about Childhood Vaccination in the United States: Political Ideology, False Consensus, and the Illusion of Uniqueness","M Rabinowitz, L Latella, C Stern, JT Jost",PloS one,July,July 2016,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158382,"Several contagious diseases were nearly eradicated through childhood vaccination, but some parents have decided in recent years not to fully vaccinate their children, raising new public health concerns. The question of whether and how beliefs about vaccination are linked to political ideology has been hotly debated. This study investigates the effects of ideology on perceptions of harms and benefits related to vaccination as well as judgments of others’ attitudes. A total of 367 U.S. adults (131 men, 236 women; Mage = 34.92 years, range = 18–72) completed an online survey through Mechanical Turk. Results revealed that liberals were significantly more likely to endorse pro-vaccination statements and to regard them as “facts” (rather than “beliefs”), in comparison with moderates and conservatives. Whereas conservatives overestimated the proportion of like-minded others who agreed with them, liberals underestimated the proportion of others who agreed with them. That is, conservatives exhibited the “truly false consensus effect,” whereas liberals exhibited an “illusion of uniqueness” with respect to beliefs about vaccination. Conservative and moderate parents in this sample were less likely than liberals to report having fully vaccinated their children prior to the age of two. A clear limitation of this study is that the sample is not representative of the U.S. population. Nevertheless, a recognition of ideological sources of potential variability in health-related beliefs and perceptions is a prerequisite for the design of effective forms of public communication.",
Psych,,,,10,Searching for the Prosocial Personality A Big Five Approach to Linking Personality and Prosocial Behavior,"MM Habashi, WG Graziano, AE Hoover",Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,July,July 2016,http://psp.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/06/08/0146167216652859.abstract,"The search for the prosocial personality has been long and controversial. The current research explores the general patterns underlying prosocial decisions, linking personality, emotion, and overt prosocial behavior. Using a multimethod approach, we explored the links between the Big Five dimensions of personality and prosocial responding. Across three studies, we found that agreeableness was the dimension of personality most closely associated with emotional reactions to victims in need of help, and subsequent decisions to help those individuals. Results suggest that prosocial processes, including emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, may be part of a more general motivational process linked to personality.",

Experiential avoidance (EA) has been investigated as a factor relevant in many forms of psychopathology, including borderline personality disorder. To date however, no study has yet investigated whether EA might also be relevant to OCPD. We administered a measure of EA and a multidimensional OCPD measure (assessing 5 OCPD trait dimensions and overall severity) to a large community sample (N = 571) as well as a group of individuals with self-identified OCPD features (N = 53). Results revealed that the OCPD group experienced heightened EA relative to the unscreened community sample, even controlling for group differences in distress symptoms. Correlational analyses showed significant relationships between EA and all 5 OCPD trait dimensions and overall severity. Moreover, EA accounted for OCPD traits and severity after controlling for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Implications for the role of EA in OCPD, including treatment implications, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Method: Outpatients (32 female, 26 male, mean age = 45 years) completed interpersonal circumplex measures of goals, efficacy, and problems before completing 20 weeks of manualized group therapy, during which we regularly assessed depression and interpersonal style. Results: Compared to normative samples, patients lacked interpersonal agency, including less self-efficacy for expressive/assertive actions; stronger motives to avoid conflict, scorn, and humiliation; and more problems with being too submissive, inhibited, and accommodating. Behavioral Activation and especially Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy interventions produced improvements in depression and interpersonal agency, with increases in “agentic and communal” efficacy predicting subsequent decreases in depression. Conclusions: While severely and persistently depressed patients were prone to express maladaptive interpersonal dispositions, over the course of group therapy, they showed increasingly agentic and beneficial patterns of cognitions, motives, and behaviors.",

Conservatives — particularly religious conservatives — have come to champion a politics of rights, using “liberal weapons” (rights) to win battles or at least stave off loses. This raises important questions about the long-run effects of making rights claims. Does rights claiming lead to balkanization and reinforce group boundaries or is rights claiming an education in the democratic process that promotes tolerance? Drawing on evidence from an experimental design, we find that exposure to rights claims made by clergy regarding exemptions from participation in same-sex ceremonies acts as a prime to boost tolerance of selected least-liked groups, an effect particularly potent for evangelical Protestants.",
Technology,,,,14,Beyond entities: promoting explorative search with bundles,"I Bordino, M Lalmas, Y Mejova, O Van Laere",Information Retrieval Journal,July,July 2016,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10791-016-9283-5,"Search engines are increasingly going beyond the pure relevance of search results to entertain users with information items that are interesting and even surprising, albeit sometimes not fully related to their search intent. In this paper, we study this serendipitous search space in the context of entity search, which has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building semantically rich answers. Specifically, our work proposes to enhance an explorative search system that represents a large sample of Yahoo Answers as an entity network, with a result structuring that goes beyond ranked lists, using composite entity retrieval, which requires a bundling of the results. We propose and compare six bundling methods, which exploit topical categories, entity specializations, and sentiment, and go beyond simple entity clustering. Two large-scale crowd-sourced studies show that users find a bundled organization—especially based on the topical categories of the query entity—to be better at revealing the most useful results, as well as at organizing the results, helping to discover novel and interesting information, and promoting exploration. Finally, a third study of 30 simulated search tasks reveals the bundled search experience to be less frustrating and more rewarding, with more users willing to recommend it to others.",
Buisiness/ Marketing,,,,15,Powerful or powerless customers: the influence of gratitude on engagement with CSR,"Anna S. Mattila , Laurie Wu , Choongbeom Choi ,",Journal of Services Marketing,July,July 2016,http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JSM-07-2014-0233,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine how gratitude appeals and consumers’ sense of power jointly influence customer engagement in a service firm’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Based on previous literature, the authors propose that power moderates the effect of gratitude expression on consumers’ attitudes and behavioral intention to engage in matching donations. Design/methodology/approach: A 2 (power: powerful vs powerless) × 2 (gratitude expression: included in the request vs none) between-subjects experiment was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Participants were asked to imagine that they recently saw a donation request while dining at a local restaurant and they then complete scales that measured their attitude and donation intention to engage in a restaurant’s CSR practice. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that an expression of gratitude enhanced powerless but not powerful customers’ intention to engage in CSR practices. In addition, moderated mediation tests revealed social worth concerns as the underlying mechanism between gratitude expression and customer engagement for powerless consumers. However, such mediation effects were not observed for powerful consumers. Originality/value: The current study identifies sense of power as a new psychological state that can influence donation behaviors in the context of CSR. In addition, the current study shows that the serial mediating role of social worth between gratitude expression and prosocial behaviors only holds true for individuals with a low sense of power.",
Psych,,,,16,Openness and other Big Five traits in relation to dispositional mixed emotions,"KA Barford, LD Smillie",Personality and Individual Differences,July,July 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916308327,"Despite accumulating evidence for concurrent feelings of positivity and negativity (e.g., simultaneous happiness and sadness), little is known about individual differences in these mixed emotions experiences. We examined relations between a novel measure of dispositional mixed emotions (the Trait Mixed Emotions Scale; TMES) and the Big Five trait domains and aspects. We derived two a-priori predictions: (1) Openness/Intellect—reflecting cognitive flexibility and exploration—would predict the TMES, and (2) Extraversion and Neuroticism—reflecting susceptibility to positive and negative emotions, respectively—would jointly predict the TMES. Results showed that two measures of the Openness aspect of Openness/Intellect positively predicted TMES scores. Extraversion and Neuroticism did not jointly predict the TMES. Neuroticism positively predicted the TMES, but this reflected the relation of Neuroticism with dispositional negative emotions. The Volatility aspect of Neuroticism, however, was a positive predictor of the TMES beyond its relation with trait negativity. Our findings inform further study of differential mixed emotions experiences, and may help consolidate the previous fragmented literature in this area.",
Psych,,,,17,Telling in-tune from out-of-tune: widespread evidence for implicit absolute intonation,"SC Van Hedger, SLM Heald, A Huang, B Rutstein, HC Nusbaum",Psychonomic Bulletin & Review,July,July 2016,http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1099-1,"Absolute pitch (AP) is the rare ability to name or produce an isolated musical note without the aid of a reference note. One skill thought to be unique to AP possessors is the ability to provide absolute intonation judgments (e.g., classifying an isolated note as “in-tune” or “out-of-tune”). Recent work has suggested that absolute intonation perception among AP possessors is not crystallized in a critical period of development, but is dynamically maintained by the listening environment, in which the vast majority of Western music is tuned to a specific cultural standard. Given that all listeners of Western music are constantly exposed to this specific cultural tuning standard, our experiments address whether absolute intonation perception extends beyond AP possessors. We demonstrate that non-AP listeners are able to accurately judge the intonation of completely isolated notes. Both musicians and nonmusicians showed evidence for absolute intonation recognition when listening to familiar timbres (piano and violin). When testing unfamiliar timbres (triangle and inverted sine waves), only musicians showed weak evidence of absolute intonation recognition (Experiment 2). Overall, these results highlight a previously unknown similarity between AP and non-AP possessors’ long-term musical note representations, including evidence of sensitivity to frequency.",

While the relationships between health and masculinity, identity, and attachment have been reported, much less is known as to how these factors influence the decision to screen for cancer. This study aimed to determine the influence identified health and social factors have on cancer screening among Black men. Participants (N = 369) were surveyed on questions assessing cancer knowledge, belief about cancer diagnoses, masculinity, self-esteem, attachment style, ethnic identity, and additional social and health characteristics. Results from the multivariate model showed that education, ethnic identity, masculinity, and attachment were significant indicators of cancer screening. Cancer screenings among Black men are contingent upon a myriad of psychological, social, and behavioral factors that are not exclusive, but rather coexisting determinants of health. Understanding the motivation for cancer screening among Black men may begin to diminish the prevalence of having an imminent and aggressive stage of diagnosis among this gendered population. Focusing exclusively on Black men enhances our understanding of this adult population by considering their identity as men of color, while recognizing unique factors that modify actions at the individual, institutional, and policy levels.",
Psych,,,,19,The effects of gamelike features and test location on cognitive test performance and participant enjoyment,"Lumsden J, Skinner A, Woods AT, Lawrence NS, Munafò M",PeerJ,July,July 2016,https://peerj.com/articles/2184/,"Computerised cognitive assessments are a vital tool in the behavioural sciences, but participants often view them as effortful and unengaging. One potential solution is to add gamelike elements to these tasks in order to make them more intrinsically enjoyable, and some researchers have posited that a more engaging task might produce higher quality data. This assumption, however, remains largely untested. We investigated the effects of gamelike features and test location on the data and enjoyment ratings from a simple cognitive task. We tested three gamified variants of the Go-No-Go task, delivered both in the laboratory and online. In the first version of the task participants were rewarded with points for performing optimally. The second version of the task was framed as a cowboy shootout. The third version was a standard Go-No-Go task, used as a control condition. We compared reaction time, accuracy and subjective measures of enjoyment and engagement between task variants and study location. We found points to be a highly suitable game mechanic for gamified cognitive testing because they did not disrupt the validity of the data collected but increased participant enjoyment. However, we found no evidence that gamelike features could increase engagement to the point where participant performance improved. We also found that while participants enjoyed the cowboy themed task, the difficulty of categorising the gamelike stimuli adversely affected participant performance, increasing No-Go error rates by 28% compared to the non-game control. Responses collected online vs. in the laboratory had slightly longer reaction times but were otherwise very similar, supporting other findings that online crowdsourcing is an acceptable method of data collection for this type of research.",

Our susceptibility to inattentional blindness increases as we age. We explored three potential moderators of the age and inattentional blindness relationship: (1) the spatial proximity of the unexpected object to our focus of attention; (2) the match between the features of the unexpected object and those we have prioritized—our attention set; and (3) the salience of the unexpected object. Using a large sample of participants, we found no evidence that any of these moderate the effect that age has on inattentional blindness; the effect of age is robust. We discuss the implications for older drivers.",

Even though pie charts have been around for over 200 years, our understanding of the perceptual factors used to read data in them is still limited. Data is encoded in pie and donut charts in three ways: arc length, center angle, and segment area. For our first study, we designed variations of pie charts to test the importance of individual encodings for reading accuracy. In our second study, we varied the inner radius of a donut chart from a filled pie to a thin outline to test the impact of removing the central angle. Both studies point to angle being the least important visual cue for both charts, and the donut chart being as accurate as the traditional pie chart.",

This paper characterizes and compares local perceptions of the water system and hydro-climate information in the seasonally dry province of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 40 participants from 7 water-related groups. Interview results were used to compare mental models of the drivers of water systems and water scarcity mitigation/adaptation options, and relate them to stakeholder information needs, accuracy ratings, and use. Our results suggest that: 1) while there appear to be similar perceptions of the drivers of rainfall and groundwater, there is a gap between groups in the use of forecasts, the awareness of management options, and the level of detailed understanding of how the water system works; 2) there are potential mismatches between the information presented in rainfall forecasts and the stated and/or salient information needs of some stakeholders, specifically in the case of groundwater resources; 3) there appear to be different perceptions of forecasts even among groups that rate the accuracy of such forecasts the same; and 4) there appears to be a relationship between the use of forecasts and certain types of management actions such as long-term planning. Our findings warrant further investigation and confirmation and may contribute to the development of communications that help stakeholders make informed decisions about freshwater management in semi-arid regions.",

Drawing on conservation of resources theory and the notion that employees have finite emotional resources, this study aims to examine the consequences of emotional labour among employees who simultaneously work in two service jobs. The authors posit that emotional labour requirements from the primary job and secondary job interact to emotionally exhaust employees through a process of resource depletion. Specifically, building on extant work, this research tests a theoretical mediation model of surface acting predicting organizational commitment through emotional exhaustion. Design/methodology/approach Employing a predictive survey approach, 171 frontline-service employees with two jobs from a variety of service industries are surveyed in two waves. The hypothesized model is tested using a bootstrap procedure for testing indirect effects. In addition, the authors investigate first- and second-stage moderation. Findings Results confirm full mediation of the relationship between surface acting and organizational commitment by emotional exhaustion, confirming that the effect of surface acting on organizational commitment is indirect through emotional exhaustion. In addition, results reveal that surface acting in the secondary job moderates the link between surface acting in the primary job and emotional exhaustion, and that employees low on organizational identification congruence display lower levels of organizational commitment with the primary job. Research limitations/implications This study contributes to the literature that relates emotional labour to organizational commitment by investigating contingent factors. The key contribution thus pertains to identifying contingent factors based in COR theory and social identity theory that influence the triadic relation between surface acting, emotional exhaustion and organizational commitment. Practical implications Results reveal that surface acting in a second job not just simply adds to the level of employee emotional exhaustion. Instead levels of surface acting in a first and second job interact with each other to affect emotional exhaustion. This finding suggests service managers must take into account if and how employees are enforced to perform surface acting in the other job to prevent high exhaustion.

Based on a sample of 313 men and women, we developed and tested both a general measure and a domain-specific measure of the ZSP of gender status then examined sociodemographics (age, education, political orientation, religious beliefs, and past experience with discrimination) and social dominance orientation as predictors of the ZSP of shifts in gender status. Hostile and modern sexism were examined as potential mediators of this relationship. Structural equation models were computed to examine predictive paths separately for men and women. Although some similarities were found, results showed important differences in predictive paths for women and men, and supported the expected mediating role of sexism in the relationships between sociodemographic predictors and the ZSP. Findings have implications for targeting intervention efforts to enhance a win-win or non-zero-sum perspective that may facilitate efforts toward reducing gender discrimination.",

Since the research on hotel environmental management often overlooks organizational factors, this study investigated the effects of an environmental management strategy (EMS) on organizational citizenship behavior and tested the mediating roles of organizational trust and commitment in explaining those effects. Design/methodology/approach An online survey of U.S. hotel employees yielded 373 complete responses. Data were analyzed with structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings EMS positively affected organizational trust and commitment, which ultimately influenced organizational citizenship behavior. Furthermore, organizational trust and commitment fully mediated the relationship between EMS and organizational citizenship behavior. Practical implications The results establish the foundation for applying EMS in organizational operations. The findings can benefit managers, as they show how hotel firms’ prosocial practices can enhance employees’ positive behaviors. Originality/value Despite the importance of employee attitudes and behaviors, little is known about the mechanism by which employees perceive the influence of an EMS on organizational citizenship behaviors. Therefore, the study examined organizational trust and commitment as mediators of the relationship between EMS and organizational citizenship behavior.",

Few of the participants (16%–32%) reported that they were or would be always honest across these sites, and even fewer (0–2%) suspected that others were always honest in these different online venues. In terms of types of lie, most (55–90%) believed that others were at least sometimes lying about their age, gender, activities, interests, and appearance across the four online venues. Ninety percent expected others to lie at least sometimes about their appearance (most expected lie type) and 55% expected others to lie at least sometimes about their gender (least expected lie type). However, although they expected people to lie more about their gender on sites with more anonymity and invisibility (like anonymous chat rooms and sexual websites), they expected equal rates of lies about appearance across all four websites, even on sites where users provide pictures and have shared acquaintances. Moreover, perceptions of others’ lying behavior on the venue were more significant predictors of own lying behavior than any of the personal characteristics we measured (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, extraversion, or internet addiction). The importance of mutuality was further reinforced by qualitative comments that showed that, in addition to lying to look more attractive or for privacy or protection concerns, some people lie “because everyone lies on the internet.”",

This leads to a conundrum when people make judgments from memory: They may encode an option’s ordinal rank relative to the surrounding options but later observe a different distribution of options. Do people update their representations when making judgments from memory, or do they maintain their representations based on the initial encoding? In three studies, we found that people making memory-based judgments rely on a stimulus’s relative standing in the distribution at the time of encoding rather than attending to absolute quality or updating the stimulus’s ordinal ranking in light of the distribution at the time of the later judgment.",

Methods: A total of 340 Amazon Mechanical Turk survey takers read variations of a vignette depicting an individual with schizophrenia and then completed a brief stigma measure. The vignette varied in a single sentence in which three different words—“stigma,” “prejudice,” and “reactions”—were used to describe coworkers’ possible attitudes toward the depicted individual. Results: Stigma ratings did not differ by vignette group. “Reactions” was viewed as significantly less disrespectful than both “stigma” and “prejudice” (p<.001). Conclusions: Further research is needed to support replacing the word “stigma” in public arenas. Current efforts to remove the word may unnecessarily distract advocates and policy makers from the primary mission of erasing stigma.",

Personhood, however, is often linked to personal agency (e.g., self-control, ability to plan). In the present study, 279 laypeople estimated the amount of agency and experience in hypothetical patients differing in degree of consciousness. Participants also indicated whether they would choose to maintain or terminate life support. Patients were more likely to terminate life support for a patient in a persistent vegetative state (PVS), followed by one with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in a minimally conscious state (MCS). The decision to maintain life support was reliably predicted by perceptions of a patient’s agency but life support decisions were not significantly predicted by ratings of experience. In sum, decisions regarding maintaining life support are more influenced by perceptions of a patient’s ability to plan and act than by perceptions of a patient’s ability to feel or experience.",

The contextual cues provide information about the excitement levels in the game, which can be ranked and selected to automatically produce high-quality basketball highlights. We introduce a new dataset of 25 NCAA games along with their play-by-play stats and the groundtruth excitement data for each basket.

Few studies have determined the distinct roles that positive and negative outcomes play in stimulus-response learning in cocaine users. The purpose of the present study was to investigate sensitivity to learning from positive and negative outcomes on a probabilistic learning task in cocaine users employing human laboratory and crowdsourcing techniques. Methods Individuals who reported cocaine use were recruited for a laboratory study (Experiment 1) or an online study on Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk (mTurk) (Experiment 2). All participants completed a feedback-based probabilistic learning task in which images were classified into categories (A versus B). Positive and negative outcomes were provided in a probabilistic manner on separate trials. Proportion of optimal responses and response times were recorded. Results Active cocaine users were less sensitive to learning from positive relative to negative outcomes. These effects were consistent across image type and session in the laboratory sample. Similarly, reduced sensitivity to learning from positive outcomes was observed in cocaine users on mTurk. Control participants did not show suboptimal performance following positive or negative outcomes. Conclusions This study extends the limited research on feedback-based learning in drug users by demonstrating reduced sensitivity to positive outcomes in cocaine users recruited in the human laboratory and online. Future studies on the clinical significance and mechanisms underlying this bias are needed to understand its relevance as a target for intervention development.",

However, participants from traditional campus- and community-based samples may also engage in behaviors which adversely affect the quality of the data that they provide. We compare an MTurk, campus, and community sample to measure how frequently participants report engaging in problematic respondent behaviors.

Findings from two studies reported here provide empirical support for the perception that adult picky eaters also have significantly different diets from their peers. Adult picky eaters were compared to their non-picky peers on dietary variety (Study 1), and self-reported daily intake of fruits, vegetables, protein, dairy, starches and grains, desserts, snack foods, and soda (Study 2). In Study 1, picky eaters reported eating less varied diets than peers; their variety was particularly low for vegetables, fruits, and fish. In Study 2, picky eaters reported fewer daily servings of fruits and vegetables, and were more likely to report diets that omitted fruits and vegetables and/or failed to meet the recommended 5 daily servings; these findings were more pronounced among picky eaters who reported experiencing symptoms of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder due to picky eating. Food neophobia and rigid, inflexible eating behavior, two characteristics of picky eating, were each negatively related to daily fruit and vegetable intake; eating inflexibilty was also associated with reduced dietary variety. Although as many as 35% of otherwise healthy adults identify themselves as picky eaters, very little research has explored dietary variety or daily fruit and vegetable intake in these individuals. This gap in the literature is striking given widespread public health concern with improving diet quality in an effort to fight rising rates of obesity and related morbidity.",

However, little is understood about the circumstances that encourage health information sharing following these events. Using a Mechanical Turk sample (N = 281), this study employed a questionnaire to examine the role of parasocial attachment to Robin Williams and experienced grief following his suicide in explaining health information sharing on social network sites (i.e., sharing information about clinical depression, suicide prevention, substance abuse treatment, and Parkinson’s disease).

Visual aids tend to help diverse and vulnerable individuals understand risk communications, as long as these individuals have a basic understanding of graphs (i.e., graph literacy). Tests of objective graph literacy (OGL) can effectively identify individuals with limited skills, highlighting vulnerabilities and facilitating custom-tailored risk communication. However, the administration of these tests can be time-consuming and may evoke negative emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety). Objectives. To evaluate a brief and easy-to-use assessment of subjective graph literacy (SGL) (i.e., self-reported ability to process and use graphically presented information) and to estimate the robustness and validity of the SGL scale and compare it with the leading OGL scale in diverse samples from different cultures. Participants. Demographically diverse residents (n = 470) of the United States, young adults (n = 172) and patients (n = 175) from Spain, and surgeons (n = 175) from 48 countries. Design. A focus group and 4 studies for instrument development and initial validation (study 1), reliability and convergent and discriminant validity evaluation (study 2), and predictive validity estimation (studies 3 and 4). Measures. Psychometric properties of the scale. Results. In about 1 minute, the SGL scale provides a reliable, robust, and valid assessment of skills and risk communication preferences and evokes fewer negative emotional reactions than the OGL scale. Conclusions. The SGL scale can be suitable for use in clinical research and may be useful as a communication aid in clinical practice. Theoretical mechanisms involved in SGL, emerging applications, limitations, and open questions are discussed.",

Drawing on literature about the impact of psychological feelings of power, this research examines how power motivation interacts with the presence of disparaging humour in ads to influence ad-related outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Following the measurement (Study 1) or manipulation (Study 2) of power motivation, participants viewed an ad featuring either disparaging humour or one of the following alternatives: no humour (Study 1) or non-disparaging humour (Study 2). Sense of superiority, brand attitude, ad claim recall, and the perceived humorousness of the ad were then assessed. Findings Featuring disparaging humour in an ad increased participants’ sense of superiority, but only among those with high power motivation. Among such participants, this heightened sense of superiority increased the perceived humorousness of the disparaging humour (Studies 1 and 2), induced more favourable attitudes towards the brand featured in the ad (Studies 1 and 2), and enhanced ad claim recall (Study 2). These effects did not, however, extend to ads featuring non-disparaging humour (Study 2), indicating that it was the presence of disparaging humour, and not humour per se, that was responsible for these effects.

Contrary to a large and influential body of work suggesting that specific affective experiences are tethered to specific cognitive outcomes, the affect-as-cognitive-feedback account maintains that affective experiences confer positive or negative value on currently dominant processing styles, and thus can lead to either global or local processing (Huntsinger, Isbell, & Clore, 2014). The current work extends this theoretical perspective by investigating the impact of discrete negative emotions on the self-concept. By experimentally manipulating information processing styles and discrete negative emotions that vary in appraisals of certainty, we demonstrate that the impact of discrete negative emotions on the spontaneous self-concept depends on accessible processing styles. When global processing was accessible, individuals in angry (negative, high certainty) states generated more abstract statements about themselves than individuals in either sad (Experiment 1) or fearful (Experiment 2; negative, low certainty) states. When local processing was made accessible, however, the opposite pattern emerged, whereby individuals in angry states generated fewer abstract statements than individuals in sad or fearful states. Together these studies provide new insights into the mechanisms through which discrete emotions influence cognition. In contrast to theories assuming a dedicated link between emotions and processing styles, these results suggest that discrete emotions provide feedback about accessible ways of thinking, and are consistent with recent evidence suggesting that the impact of affect on cognition is highly context-dependent.

To generate evidence for this, we obtained a license from the Commonwealth of Australia to use up to eight of their current warning images (figure 1). Our randomised trial, entitled California smokers in Australia (CASA), will enrol 450 cigarette users who are not ready to quit and randomise them to purchase cigarettes that have been repackaged into either plain packs, current Australian packs or to a no-change control, for a period of 3 months.2 Warning labels on cigarette packs can cue cognitions on health consequences each time the consumer reaches for a cigarette, until he or she becomes desensitised. Accordingly, rotating multiple warnings is needed to increase the time before any particular warning ‘wears out’.3 ,4 Because of cost concerns of manufacturing new cigarette packs in our trial, we decided to rotate only three of the graphic images in our study. In this letter, we report results from a stated preference methodology that allowed US-adult cigarette users to identify which of the eight licensed Australian warnings they believed would be most effective.",

These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the total level of group resources (i.e. social efficiency) and distributing these resources among group members (i.e. individuals’ relative shares). This is the case because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus resulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dualprocess approach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension. We conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different allocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed approach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using the Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the experimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness, experiments were conducted in two countries: the US and India. Despite aggregate differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time pressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals’ concerns for their relative shares; (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with individuals’ concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that deliberation favors social efficiency by overriding individuals’ intuitive tendency to focus on relative shares.",

This work focuses on a subset of decision strategies that allows individuals to make decisions by bypassing the decision-making process—a phenomenon we term decision sidestepping. Critical to the present manuscript, however, we contend that decision sidestepping stems from the motivation to achieve closure. We link this proposition back to the fundamental nature of closure and how those seeking closure are highly bothered by decision making. As such, we argue that the motivation to achieve closure prompts a reliance on sidestepping strategies (e.g., default bias, choice delegation, status quo bias, inaction inertia, option fixation) to reduce the bothersome nature of decision making. In support of this framework, five experiments demonstrate that (a) those seeking closure are more likely to engage in decision sidestepping, (b) the effect of closure on sidestepping stems from the bothersome nature of decision making, and (c) the reliance on sidestepping results in downstream consequences for subsequent choice. Taken together, these findings offer unique insight into the cognitive motivations stimulating a reliance on decision sidestepping and thus a novel framework by which to understand how individuals make decisions while bypassing the decision-making process.

The primary source of evidence for this “jumping to conclusions” (JTC) bias is provided by research that utilises the “beads task” data-gathering paradigm. However, the cognitive mechanisms subserving data gathering in this task are poorly understood. Methods: In the largest published beads task study to date (n = 558), we examined data gathering in the context of influential dual-process theories of reasoning. Results: Analytic cognitive style (the willingness or disposition to critically evaluate outputs from intuitive processing and engage in effortful analytic processing) predicted data gathering in a non-clinical sample, but delusional ideation did not. Conclusion: The relationship between data gathering and analytic cognitive style suggests that dual-process theories of reasoning can contribute to our understanding of the beads task. It is not clear why delusional ideation was not found to be associated with data gathering or analytic cognitive style.",

They must also continue to behave securely. However, if secure behaviors are difficult to practice, it is not surprising that technology users will abandon them or find ways to subvert policies. For example, in the context of password authentication, login success rates may determine whether users continue to use a strong credential or switch to less secure behaviors (e.g., storing a credential or changing to a weaker, albeit easier to successfully enter, credential). This is particularly concerning given the shift toward mobile devices in the workplace that present opportunities for both increased value and risk. Mobile devices are based on a small user interface and keypad that present challenges to users. Therefore, it is possible that mobile device usage may lead to poorer text-based authentication practices. We conduct a longitudinal field experiment to test our predictions and find that the mobile interface does reduce login success rates. In turn, these failures lead to discontinuance of a secure behavior and the adoption of less-secure behaviors. Alarmingly, this effect does not seem to disappear with increased practice using a mobile interface. In fact, our results indicate that more practice with a mobile interface appears to only lead to an increase in poor security behaviors over time.",

Though VC is widely recognized as a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying polyps, one limitation is the reading time, which can take on average 30 minutes per patient. Large amounts of the colon are often devoid of polyps, and a way of identifying these polyp-free segments could be of valuable use in reducing the required reading time for the interrogating radiologist. To this end, we have tested the ability of the collective crowd intelligence of non-expert workers to identify polyp candidates and polyp-free regions. We presented twenty short videos flying through a segment of a virtual colon to each worker, and the crowd workers are asked to determine whether or not a polyp candidate was observed within that video segment. We evaluated our framework on Amazon Mechanical Turk and found that the crowd was able to achieve a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 86.5% in identifying video segments which contained a clinically proven polyp. Since each polyp appeared in multiple consecutive segments, all polyps were in fact identified. Using the crowd results as a first pass, 80% of the video segments could be skipped by the radiologist, equating to a significant time savings and enabling more VC examinations to be performed.",

When faced with recruitment challenges, a common response by firms is to increase pay level, an incentive that is somewhat easily competed away as other firms follow suit. The following instead examines the incentive effects of pay mix in motivated job choice decisions. Relevant research is reviewed to establish the conceptual foundation. Then through experimental design, we investigate whether job postings that are alike on all substantive qualities except pay mix policy distinguish job appeal in a systematic way. Our findings provide preliminary support for stronger incentive effects with a work–life balance pay mix policy, relative to market-match and performance driven pay mix policies. Job postings that conveyed a work–life pay mix were rated as significantly more appealing by both men and women. Further, this pattern of preference was distinctly larger for women relative to men, which speaks to the practical aspect of attracting a gender-diverse applicant pool. Findings will inform research and practice on the incentive qualities of total compensation (pay and benefits), often given short shrift in comparison to the monetary component of compensation alone.

Objective. The main goal of this study was to explore the effect of a one-session intervention on participants' clinical symptoms (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and related variables (mood, confidence and motivation). Method A total of 765 adults residing in the United States took part in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five brief plain text interventions lasting five to ten minutes. The interventions designed to address depressive symptoms were: Thoughts (increasing helpful thoughts), Activities (increasing activity level), Sleep Hygiene, Assertiveness (increasing assertiveness awareness), Own Methods (utilizing methods that were previously successful). They were followed-up one week after consenting. Results A main effect of time was observed for both depression (F(1, 563) = 234.70, p < 0.001) and anxiety (F(1, 551) = 170.27, p < 0.001). In all cases, regardless of assigned condition and Major Depressive Episode status, mean scores on both positive outcomes (mood, confidence and motivation) and negative outcome scores (depression and anxiety) improved over time. Conclusions Brief Internet intervention can improve depressive symptoms at one-week follow-up. Further outcome data and research implications will be discussed.",

Crowdsourcing offers the opportunity for gathering data much more quickly and inexpensively than from most targeted populations. In a simulation of a pilot testing protocol, item parameters for 110 life science questions are estimated from 4,043 crowdsourced adult subjects and then compared with those from 20,937 middle school science students. In terms of item discrimination classification (high versus low), classical test theory (CTT) yields an acceptable level of agreement (C-statistic = 0.755); item response theory (IRT) produces excellent results (C-statistic = 0.848). IRT also identifies potential anchor items without including any false positives (items with low discrimination in the targeted population). We conclude that the use of crowdsourced subjects is a reasonable, efficient method for the identification of high quality items and of anchors for test equating.",

This is typically accomplished using either expert coders to quantify the relevant information or machine coders to automatically extract data from documents. Although expert coding is costly, it produces quality data. Machine coding is fast and inexpensive, but the data are noisy. To diminish the severity of this tradeoff, we introduce a method for analyzing news documents that uses crowdsourcing, supplemented with computational approaches. The new method is tested on documents about Militarized Interstate Disputes, and its accuracy ranges between about 68 and 76 percent. This is shown to be a considerable improvement over automated coding, and to cost less and be much faster than expert coding.",

In this paper, 178 participants multitasked in a synthetic work environment (SYNWORK) consisting of memory, visual monitoring, auditory monitoring, and math tasks. Participants multitasked for a 3-min baseline phase (MT1), following which they were randomly assigned to watch one of three affect-induction videos: positive, neutral, or negative. Participants then resumed multitasking for two additional critical phases (MT2, MT3; 3 min each). In MT2, performance of the positive and neutral conditions was statistically equivalent and higher than the negative condition. In MT3, the positive condition performed better than the negative condition, with the neutral condition not significantly different from the other two. The differences in overall multitasking scores were largely driven by errors in the Math task (the most cognitively demanding task) in MT2 and the Memory task in MT3. These findings have implications for how positive and negative affective states influence processing in a cognitively demanding multitasking environment.",

In Study 2, participants completed the same free will manipulation and a moral decision-making task. We then assessed participants’ perceived sense of authenticity during the task. Results illustrated that attenuating free will beliefs led to less self-knowledge, such that participants reported feeling more alienated from their true selves and experienced lowered perceptions of authenticity while making moral decisions. The interplay between free will and the true self are discussed.",

Participants in this study, a nationwide sample of clients recruited through Amazon’s MTurk system, were asked to complete an online survey assessing their attitudes towards treatment use by therapists as well as their general attitudes towards psychological help-seeking and perceptions of stigma (social and self) with psychological treatments. In this study, we found that clients generally had positive views about therapists’ personal use of psychotherapy or counselling. Although overall positive attitudes were found, the results from repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that attitudes depended somewhat on whether the therapist had sought out treatment as part of a training requirement for self-enrichment, or for the treatment of a psychological problem. In addition, participating clients were less supportive of therapists disclosing a treatment use history with their clients. Regression analyses also indicated that attitudes towards treatment use by therapists were significantly predicted by general help-seeking attitudes and perceptions of stigma (social and self), but attitudes towards disclosure were not. The findings from this study have important implications regarding therapist treatment use and disclosure in practice.",

The current study aimed at testing whether compared with other employment groups, fewer leisure activities observed in unemployment may contribute to elevated risk for negative mental health via loss of time structure. Methods Depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression), leisure activities (exercise, self-focused, social), and time structure (Time Structure Questionnaire (TSQ)) were assessed cross-sectionally in 406 participants (unemployed=155, employed=140, homemakers=111) recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results Controlling for gender and age, structural equation modelling revealed time structure partially (employed, homemakers) and fully (unemployed) mediated the relationship between leisure activities and depressive symptoms. With the exception of differential effects for structured routines, all other TSQ factors (sense of purpose, present orientation, effective organisation and persistence) contributed significantly to all models. Conclusions These findings support the idea that especially for the unemployed, leisure activities impose their mental health benefits through increasing individuals' perception of spending their time effectively. Social leisure activities that provide a sense of daily structure may thereby be a particularly promising low-cost intervention to improve mental health in this population.",

Previous studies of schizotypy have used primarily undergraduate or small community samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate correlates of schizotypy in a large online sample. We hypothesized that people with schizotypy traits would report lower functioning, well-being, and greater stigmatizing attitudes regarding treatment. Methods: In a sample (N=856) recruited using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), participants were dichotomized into non-schizotypy or schizotypy groups based on their endorsement of schizotypal traits on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire – Brief Revised (SPQ-BR; schizotypy group n=101; non-schizotypy group n=431). Participants completed a demographic survey and several measures related to functioning, well-being, and stigma, including the Romantic Relationship Functioning Scale (RRFS), the Social Adjustment Scale – Self-Report: Screener (SAS-SR: Screener), the SPQ-BR, the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12), and the Stigma Scale for Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH). Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to compare schizotypy groups on these variables. Results: Those who reported high levels of schizotypy reported significantly poorer social functioning, t(122.74)=-10.66, p<.001; poorer romantic relationship functioning, t(129.01)=12.00, p<.001; poorer mental wellbeing ,t(132.58)=13.42, p=.001; and greater stigma toward receiving psychological treatment, t(137.06)=-3.89, p=.037. There was no significant difference in physical wellbeing. Discussion: These findings support the use of online samples and suggest schizotypy is associated with poorer functioning and wellbeing and increased stigma toward seeking treatment. Results support the emergence of deficits in key social domains among those at risk for developing greater psychosis symptoms. Given the links between these deficits and attitudes and poorer functioning in clinical samples, these findings suggest social functioning and help-seeking attitudes may be important targets of early intervention services.",

Consistent with our Hypothesis, individuals scoring higher in Honesty-Humility requested CMR less frequently.

Enhanced absolute pitch memory for a 1000Hz sine tone,"SC Van Hedger, SLM Heald, HC Nusbaum",Cognition,June,June 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716301482,"Many individuals are able to perceive when the tuning of familiar stimuli, such as popular music recordings, has been altered. This suggests a kind of ubiquitous pitch memory, though it is unclear how this ability differs across individuals with and without absolute pitch (AP) and whether it plays any role in AP. In the present study, we take advantage of a salient single frequency – the 1000 Hz sine tone used to censor taboo words in broadcast media – to assess the nature of this kind of pitch memory across individuals with and without AP. We show that non-AP participants are accurate at selecting the correct version of the censor tone among incorrect versions shifted by either one or two semitones, though their accuracy was still below that of an AP population (Experiment 1). This suggests a benefit for AP listeners that could be due to the use of explicit note categories or greater amounts of musical training. However, AP possessors still outperformed all non-AP participants when incorrect versions of the censor tone were shifted within a note category, even when controlling for musical experience (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 demonstrated that AP listeners did not appear to possess a category label for the censor tone that could have helped them differentiate the censor tones used in Experiment 2. Overall, these results suggest that AP possessors may have better pitch memory, even when divorced from pitch labeling (note categories). As such, these results have implications for how AP may develop and be maintained.",

It is based on the best-selling books by Dr. Jane Nelsen and coauthors Lynn Lott, Cheryl Erwin, and others. These books and Positive Discipline parenting are firmly rooted in Adlerian psychology, which emphasizes the goal of belonging and significance in all individuals, and the need for kindness and firmness in parenting children. In previous research, a 7-item measure was adapted to represent some of the most emphasized aspects of Positive Discipline. This measure, the Positive Discipline Parenting Scale (PDPS), was found to have a sustained increase following 7-week parenting workshops. In this study, we examine the reliability and validity of the scale using an initial community sample (n = 107), and an online Internet sample (n = 123). Factor loadings and reliability were examined in both samples, as well as convergent and divergent validity. The measure was found to be positively correlated with authoritative parenting style and parental sense of reward, and negatively correlated with authoritarian style and parental stress. The measure may be useful as a tool for program evaluation, or for assessing a theoretical relationship between Positive Discipline style parenting and other variables of interest.",

We show that individuals who experience pleasure at serious harm that has befallen another person are judged both immoral and evil. This effect occurs for harm-causing actors, and for observers who play no role in causing the harm; actors can also be judged as immoral and evil when they experience mere indifference (Study 1). Observers are more likely to be similarly judged when they experience direct rather than indirect pleasure from harm caused to another (Study 2). The effects of pleasure are dissociable from those of malevolent desires (Study 3). Targets’ experience of pleasure at the harm caused to another person leads to the social exclusion of observers (Studies 1-3) and the harsh punishment of actors, including the death penalty (Studies 1, 4a, and 4b).",

Although a straight categorization bias is evident in many published reports, it has never been the focus of systematic inquiry. The current studies therefore document this bias and test the mechanisms that produce it. Studies 1–3 revealed the straight categorization bias cannot be explained entirely by perceivers’ attempts to match categorizations to the number of gay targets in a stimulus set. Although perceivers were somewhat sensitive to base rate information, their tendency to categorize targets as straight persisted when they believed each target had a 50% chance of being gay (Study 1), received explicit information about the base rate of gay targets in a stimulus set (Study 2), and encountered stimulus sets with varying base rates of gay targets (Study 3). The remaining studies tested an alternate mechanism for the bias based upon perceivers’ use of gender heuristics when judging sexual orientation. Specifically, Study 4 revealed the range of gendered cues compelling gay judgments is smaller than the range of gendered cues compelling straight judgments despite participants’ acknowledgment of equal base rates for gay and straight targets. Study 5 highlighted perceptual experience as a cause of this imbalance: Exposing perceivers to hyper-gendered faces (e.g., masculine men) expanded the range of gendered cues compelling gay categorizations. Study 6 linked this observation to our initial studies by demonstrating that visual exposure to hyper-gendered faces reduced the magnitude of the straight categorization bias. Collectively, these studies provide systematic evidence of a response bias in sexual orientation categorization and offer new insights into the mechanisms that produce it.

Little is known about psychosocial correlates of labor force participation (LFP) among female caregivers. The theory of planned behavior posits that social norms, attitudes, and perceived control predict intentions and volitional behaviors, but also that the compelling influence of situational variables undermines enactment of behaviors consistent with one’s intentions. The objective of this study was to employ the theory of planned behavior to examine how psychosocial characteristics predict willingness to reduce LFP among prospective caregivers and actual LFP reduction among active caregivers. Methods: Subsamples of 165 female prospective caregivers and 97 active female caregivers responded to a survey assessing filial beliefs and LFP. Results: Filial obligation and caregiver preparedness predicted intentions to reduce LFP among prospective caregivers, but did not predict actual reduction in LFP in active caregivers. Weekly care demands exceeding 20 hours emerged as the sole correlate of LFP among active caregivers.Conclusions: Domains of the theory of planned behavior predict LFP intentions, but LFP decisions are subject to external pressures, specifically, time demands of the caregiving relationship. Prospective caregivers may benefit from proactive interventions aimed at reducing conflict between situational demands and filial beliefs.",

One hundred and ninety-nine women completed an online survey measuring levels of appearance-based comparisons, body surveillance, thin ideal internalization, body esteem, and fat talk (FT-body concerns and FT-body comparisons). Results showed that fat talk made a significant contribution in explaining additional variance in body esteem above the other three body image factors, with FT-body concerns in particular making the highest unique contribution. Hierarchical regression analyses suggest that fat talk should be viewed as an independent psychosocial predictor of body esteem in both theoretical and therapeutic contexts. Future research should explore these relationships from a longitudinal perspective, and also clarify the nuances in the relationships by investigating the nature of women's everyday body image experiences.",

However, previous methods for image aesthetics analysis have primarily focused on the coarse, binary categorization of images into high- or low-aesthetic categories. In this work, we propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network to rank photo aesthetics in which the relative ranking of photo aesthetics are directly modeled in the loss function. Our model incorporates joint learning of meaningful photographic attributes and image content information which can help regularize the complicated photo aesthetics rating problem. To train and analyze this model, we have assembled a new aesthetics and attributes database (AADB) which contains aesthetic scores and meaningful attributes assigned to each image by multiple human raters. Anonymized rater identities are recorded across images allowing us to exploit intra-rater consistency using a novel sampling strategy when computing the ranking loss of training image pairs. We show the proposed sampling strategy is very effective and robust in face of subjective judgement of image aesthetics by individuals with different aesthetic tastes. Experiments demonstrate that our unified model can generate aesthetic rankings that are more consistent with human ratings. To further validate our model, we show that by simply thresholding the estimated aesthetic scores, we are able to achieve sta",

However, experiences of TRASC have not been assessed in large community samples in relation to the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM–5) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criteria. We evaluated TRASC as well as PTSD symptoms by self-report in participants recruited online (n = 2478). We also evaluated the hypotheses of the 4-D model via measures of PTSD and related psychological symptoms, dissociative experiences, and childhood trauma history. Consistent with hypotheses, relative to symptoms of NWC-distress, experiences of TRASC were (a) endorsed less frequently, (b) coendorsed less frequently, (c) predicted incremental variance in measures of dissociative experiences, and (d) were more specific to a history of childhood traumatization. An exploratory factor analysis generated a 2-factor solution that also supports the distinction between NWC-distress and TRASC. The present results generally support differentiating between dissociative versus nondissociative experiences as outcomes of posttraumatic stress.

Methods: An electronic questionnaire was prepared, and then sent to all members (n=11253) of an internet group (International Association of Endodontic Education, Research and Practice). Chi square test was used for data analysis, and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Results: Results showed that 85.5% of the participants expect postoperative pain and prescribe analgesics in patients with preoperative pain (p<0.001). Expectations of postoperative pain from using the hand files was the highest among other instrumentation techniques, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The most preferred drug type prescribed by the participants is NSAIDs (42%) (p<0.001). More than half of the participants do not prescribe a combination with narcotic for the management of postoperative pain (p<0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, postoperative pain remains a frequent suspected sequelae of endodontic procedures, especially in patients with preoperative pain and retreatment cases. The management of postoperative pain and methods for prevention show wide variations. A universal agreement is required to standardize methods to manage and prevent postoperative pain.",

Results of an online survey in the United States in December 2014 demonstrated that 16 percent of 202 participants held conspiracy beliefs. Participants who were less knowledgeable about Ebola, more mistrustful of medical organizations, and more xenophobic more strongly endorsed conspiracy beliefs. Participants who more strongly endorsed conspiracy beliefs reported that they would be less likely to seek care for Ebola and were less supportive of quarantining people returning from West Africa. Results suggest that medical mistrust may influence health behaviors during infectious disease outbreaks.",

Little is known about the American public's perceptions or knowledge about antibiotic resistant bacteria or antibiotic misuse. We hypothesized that while many people recognize antibiotic resistance as a problem, they may not understand the relationship between antibiotic consumption and selection of resistant bacteria. Methods. We developed and tested a survey asking respondents about their perceptions and knowledge regarding appropriate antibiotic use. Respondents were recruited with the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. The survey, carefully designed to assess a crowd-sourced population, asked respondents to explain ‘antibiotic resistance’ in their own words. Subsequent questions were multiple-choice. Results. Out of 215 respondents, the vast majority agreed that inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to antibiotic resistance (92%) while notable proportion (70%) responded neutrally or disagreed with the statement that antibiotic resistance is a problem. Over 40% of respondents indicated that antibiotics were the best choice to treat a fever or a runny nose and sore throat. Major themes from the free-text responses included that antibiotic resistance develops by bacteria, or by the infection, or the body (i.e. an immune response). Minor themes included antibiotic overuse and antibiotic resistance caused by bacterial adaptation or an immune response. Conclusions. Our findings indicate that the public is aware that antibiotic misuse contributes to antibiotic resistance but many do not consider it to be an important problem. The free-text responses suggest specific educational targets, including the difference between an immune response and bacterial adaptation, to increase awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance.",

They introduce their evidence-based development strategy for designing effective text-simplification software and summarize initial, promising results. They also present a new study examining existing readability formulas, which are the most commonly used tools for text simplification in healthcare. They compare syllable count--the proxy for word difficulty used by most readability formulas--with their new metric, term familiarity, and determine that syllable count measures how difficult words appear to be, but not their actual difficulty. In contrast, term familiarity can be used to measure actual difficulty.",
,,,,83,Development and Implementation of Culturally Tailored Offline Mobile Health Surveys,"Scott McIntosh1*, PhD ; José Pérez-Ramos2*, MPH ; Margaret M Demment2*, PhD ; Carmen Vélez Vega3*, PhD, MSW ; Esteban Avendaño4*, MD, MPH ; Deborah J Ossip1*, PhD ; Timothy D Dye5*, PhD ",JMIR Public Health Surveill,June,June 2016,http://publichealth.jmir.org/2016/1/e28/,"Background: In low and middle income countries (LMICs), and other areas with low resources and unreliable access to the Internet, understanding the emerging best practices for the implementation of new mobile health (mHealth) technologies is needed for efficient and secure data management and for informing public health researchers. Innovations in mHealth technology can improve on previous methods, and dissemination of project development details and lessons learned during implementation are needed to provide lessons learned to stakeholders in both the United States and LMIC settings. Objective: The aims of this paper are to share implementation strategies and lessons learned from the development and implementation stages of two survey research projects using offline mobile technology, and to inform and prepare public health researchers and practitioners to implement new mobile technologies in survey research projects in LMICs. Methods: In 2015, two survey research projects were developed and piloted in Puerto Rico and pre-tested in Costa Rica to collect face-to-face data, get formative evaluation feedback, and to test the feasibility of an offline mobile data collection process. Fieldwork in each setting involved survey development, back translation with cultural tailoring, ethical review and approvals, data collector training, and piloting survey implementation on mobile tablets. Results: Critical processes and workflows for survey research projects in low resource settings were identified and implemented. This included developing a secure mobile data platform tailored to each survey, establishing user accessibility, and training and eliciting feedback from data collectors and on-site LMIC project partners. Conclusions: Formative and process evaluation strategies are necessary and useful for the development and implementation of survey research projects using emerging mHealth technologies in LMICs and other low resource settings. Lessons learned include: (1) plan institutional review board (IRB) approvals in multiple countries carefully to allow for development, implementation, and feedback, (2) in addition to testing the content of survey instruments, allow time and consideration for testing the use of novel mHealth technology (hardware and software), (3) incorporate training for and feedback from project staff, LMIC partner staff, and research participants, and (4) change methods accordingly, including content, as mHealth technology usage influences and is influenced by the content and structure of the survey instrument. Lessons learned from early phases of LMIC research projects using emerging mHealth technologies are critical for informing subsequent research methods and study designs.",

Then question templates are matched to what the sentence is communicating in order to generate higher quality questions. This approach generated a higher percentage of acceptable questions than prior state-of-the-art systems.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms that maintain this behavior. We recruited a sample of 308 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk labor market. Participants responded to standardized measures of problematic smartphone use, and frequency of smartphone use, depression and anxiety and possible mechanisms including behavioral activation, need for touch, fear of missing out (FoMO), and emotion regulation. Problematic smartphone use was most correlated with anxiety, need for touch and FoMO. The frequency of use was most correlated (inversely) with depression. In regression models, problematic smartphone use was associated with FoMO, depression (inversely), anxiety, and need for touch. Frequency of use was associated with need for touch, and (inversely) with depressive symptoms. Behavioral activation mediated associations between smartphone use (both problematic and usage frequency) and depression and anxiety symptoms. Emotional suppression also mediated the association between problematic smartphone use and anxiety. Results demonstrate the importance of social and tactile need fulfillment variables such as FoMO and need for touch as critical mechanisms that can explain problematic smartphone use and its association with depression and anxiety.",

In a novel application of procedural priming we show that it can make or break cognitive illusions. Our test case is the 1/k illusion, which is based on the same unwarranted mathematical shortcut as the MPG illusion and the time-saving bias. The task is to estimate distances between values of fractions on the form 1/k. Most people given this task intuitively base their estimates on the distances between the denominators (i.e., the reciprocals of the fractions), which may yield very poor estimations of the true distances between the fractions. As expected, the tendency to fall for this illusion is related to cognitive style (Study 1). In order to apply procedural priming we constructed versions of the task in which the illusion is weak, in the sense that most people do not fall for it anymore. We then gave participants both “strong illusion” and “weak illusion” versions of the task (Studies 2 and 3). Participants who first did the task in the weak illusion version would often persist with the correct strategy even in the strong illusion version, thus breaking the otherwise strong illusion in the latter task. Conversely, participants who took the strong illusion version first would then often fall for the illusion even in the weak illusion version, thus strengthening the otherwise weak illusion in the latter task",

A prominent theory – termed “thick cosmopolitanism” – argues that the realization one’s ingroup is responsible for causing harm to people in distant nations will increase cosmopolitan helping behavior. Additionally, thick cosmopolitanism suggests that guilt may explain this effect. This article presents the first experimental tests of these claims, and is the first research to use experiments to investigate cosmopolitan helping. Results demonstrate a substantial, but previously unrecognized, limitation to thick cosmopolitanism. Specifically, reminders of ingroup responsibility for causing harm not only increased individuals’ acceptance of responsibility and collective guilt, which indirectly enhanced cosmopolitan helping (Studies 1 and 2), but simultaneously increased dehumanization of the harmed outgroup, which indirectly diminished helping (Study 2). These conflicting processes resulted in no overall increase in cosmopolitan helping, contrary to the predictions of thick cosmopolitanism.",

Method: We conducted an online survey (May 2013) in which participants (N = 615) were randomly assigned to read hypothetical descriptions of clinical trials for depression based on 1 of the following study designs: medication versus placebo, medication versus medication, psychotherapy versus placebo, or psychotherapy versus psychotherapy. Afterward, individuals rated willingness to participate in the trial, logic and credibility of the treatments, and expected success and improvement in symptoms. Results: There were no differences in expectancies for ratings of credibility and logic or success and improvement among clinical trial designs. However, self-reported willingness to participate in the study was rated significantly higher in the 2 psychotherapy trial designs (active-comparator and placebo-controlled) compared with the active-comparator medication design (P < .05). Psychiatric treatment history, general treatment preferences, and depression severity were positively correlated with willingness to participate primarily in the active-comparator medication design. Conclusions: Consistent with the broader treatment preference literature, individuals reported a greater willingness to participate in psychotherapy compared with antidepressant studies. Thus, people’s perceptions of different treatments are likely to influence not only the outcomes of clinical trials for depression but also decisions to participate in these trials in the first place.",

According to the semantic mediator hypothesis the testing effect arises because retrieval practice of cue-target pairs (mother-child) activates semantically related mediators (father) more than restudying. Hence, the mediator-target (father-child) association should be stronger for retrieved than restudied pairs. Indeed, Carpenter (2011) found a larger testing effect when participants received mediators (father) than when they received target-related words (birth) as final test cues. Methods The present study started as an attempt to test an alternative account of Carpenter’s results. However, it turned into a series of conceptual (Experiment 1) and direct (Experiment 2 and 3) replications conducted with online samples. The results of these online replications were compared with those of similar existing laboratory experiments through small-scale meta-analyses. Results The results showed that (1) the magnitude of the raw mediator testing effect advantage is comparable for online and laboratory experiments, (2) in both online and laboratory experiments the magnitude of the raw mediator testing effect advantage is smaller than in Carpenter’s original experiment, and (3) the testing effect for related cues varies considerably between online experiments. Conclusions The variability in the testing effect for related cues in online experiments could point toward moderators of the related cue short-term testing effect. The raw mediator testing effect advantage is smaller than in Carpenter’s original experiment.",

As web browsing activity shifts to mobile platforms, traditional browser fingerprinting techniques become less effective; however, device fingerprinting using built-in sensors offers a new avenue for attack. We study the feasibility of using motion sensors to perform device fingerprinting at scale, and explore countermeasures that can be used to protect privacy. We perform a large-scale user study to demonstrate that motion sensor fingerprinting is effective with 500 users. We also develop a model to estimate prediction accuracy for larger user populations; our model provides a conservative estimate of at least 12% classifi- cation accuracy with 100 000 users. We then investigate the use of motion sensors on the web and find, distressingly, that many sites send motion sensor data to servers for storage and analysis, paving the way to potential fingerprinting. Finally, we consider the problem of developing fingerprinting countermeasures; we evaluate a previously proposed obfuscation technique and a newly developed quantization technique via a user study. We find that both techniques are able to drastically reduce fingerprinting accuracy without significantly impacting the utility of the sensors in web applications.",

We demonstrate the utility of the corpus and its annotations in some initial measurements investigating the type of language constructions associated with strong and weak recommendations, and experiments into promising features for recommendation classification, both with respect to strong and weak labels, and to all labels of the unified scheme. An error analysis indicates that, while there is a strong relationship between lexical choices and strength labels, there can be substantial variance in the choices made by different authors.",

Here, radial frequency (RF) patterns were adapted in order to compare the Bouba/Kiki effect in Eastern and Western participants demonstrating different perceptual styles. Three attributes of the RF patterns were manipulated: The frequency, amplitude, and spikiness of the sinusoidal modulations along the circumference of a circle. By testing participants in the US and Taiwan, both cultural commonalities and differences in sound-shape correspondence were revealed. RF patterns were more likely to be matched with “Kiki” than with “Bouba” when the frequency, amplitude, and spikiness increased. The responses from both groups of participants had a similar weighting on frequency; nevertheless, the North Americans had a higher weighting on amplitude, but a lower weighting on spikiness, than their Taiwanese counterparts. These novel results regarding cultural differences suggest that the Bouba/Kiki effect is partly tuned by differing perceptual experience. In addition, using the RF patterns in the Bouba/Kiki effect provides a “mid-level” linkage between visual and auditory processing, and a future understanding of sound-shape correspondences based on the mechanism of visual pattern processing.",

However, the combustion engines would become the dominant paradigm later. Nowadays, because of several factors, the automotive industry has been researched on electric vehicles (EVs) for several decades, although this industry will have to overcome important obstacles to commercialise this kind of vehicles efficiently. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to discover to what extent some issues are key to explain consumers' willingness to buy an electric vehicle. We focus on consumers' perceptions about technical specifications of electric cars, such as charging times, consumers' perception of the price of the electric vehicle, driving range and drivers' ages, among others. We design a survey in order to obtain some factors linked to consumers' profile which are later crossed with their expectations to buy an electric vehicle. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to explain the willingness to buy an electric car by using the information of 1245 Spanish respondents. Our results indicate that the higher a consumer's perception of the price of electric vehicles and the longer charging times are, the less a consumer's willingness to buy a new electric car is. The results are useful to define key elements linked to the most appropriate industrial policy which helps companies promote the electric vehicle.",

Essentialist beliefs about aging are defined as views that link chronological age with inherent and immutable properties underlying aging-related changes. These beliefs may influence the experience of aging-related changes and shape people’s outlook of the future. We hypothesized that people who endorse essentialist beliefs about aging report a more limited future time perspective. Two studies provided correlational (Study 1, N = 250; 18–77 years) and experimental (Study 2, N = 103; 20–77 years) evidence that essentialist beliefs about aging affect people’s future time perspective. In addition, Study 2 and Study 3 (N = 174; 34–67 years) tested the underlying mechanism and provided evidence that perception of aging-related threat explains the effect of essentialist beliefs on a reduced future time perspective.

We developed and validated a past action report (PAR) in two studies using the triune ethics framework and sets of measures to examine convergent, divergent, predictive validity as well as life experience predictors. The two subtypes of self-protectionism represent neurobiological externalizing (aggressive and domineering) or internalizing (withdrawal and numbness) reactions. We examined these as well as their imagination counterparts: detached, vicious. We also examined engagement and communal imagination. Those who reported favoring particular ethical orientations were also more likely to report behaving in a manner to match that orientation.",

This paper investigates the cognitive factors that limit the consideration of referents that are supported by local lexical information but not supported by more global sentential information. In an eye-tracking paradigm, participants heard sentences like “She will eat the red pear” while viewing four black-and-white (colorless) line-drawings. In the experimental condition, the display contained a “local attractor” (e.g., a heart), which was locally compatible with the adjective but incompatible with the context (“eat”). In the control condition, the local attractor was replaced by a picture which was incompatible with the adjective (e.g., “igloo”). A second factor manipulated contextual constraint, by using either a constraining verb (e.g., “eat”), or a non-constraining one (e.g., “see”). Results showed consideration of the local attractor, the magnitude of which was modulated by verb constraint, but also by each subject’s cognitive control abilities, as measured in a separate Flanker task run on the same subjects. The findings are compatible with a processing model in which the interplay between local attraction, context, and domain-general control mechanisms determines the consideration of possible referents.",

Classic research documents that the gender of a target can affect how people deploy these perceptions of harm and fairness. Across multiple studies, we explore the effect of an individual’s moral orientations (their considerations of harm and justice) and a target’s gender on altruistic behavior. Results reveal that a target’s gender can bias one’s readiness to engage in harmful actions and that a decider’s considerations of harm—but not fairness concerns—modulate costly altruism. Together, these data illustrate that moral choices are conditional on the social nature of the moral dyad: Even under the same moral constraints, a target’s gender and a decider’s gender can shift an individual’s choice to be more or less altruistic, suggesting that gender bias and harm considerations play a significant role in moral cognition.",

Examples of this ‘win–win’ approach can be found across a wide range of industries, from encouraging the reuse of hotel towels, to the construction of energy efficient buildings, to the large-scale initiatives of multi-national corporations1, 2, 3. Although win–win strategies are generally thought to reflect positively on the organizations that employ them, here we find that people tend to respond negatively to the notion of profiting from environmental initiatives. In fact, observers may evaluate environmental win–wins less favourably than profit-seeking strategies that have no environmental benefits. The present studies suggest that how those initiatives are communicated to the general public may be of central importance. Therefore, organizations would benefit from carefully crafting the discourse around their win–win initiatives to ensure that they avoid this type of backlash.",

We provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems, and formulate hypotheses based on a parsimonious utilitarian model. We follow up at various stages in the development of our model and introduce experiments with real disposal behavior to verify these hypotheses. Our findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resource when recycling is an option and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. We extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of cost of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy perspective, our research argues for a better understanding of consumers’ disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of environmental policies and campaigns.",

The findings extend the situational theory of problem solving by adding health consciousness as an antecedent and provide empirical support for its increased predictive power in explaining communicative action, which may lead to future participation in fundraising events. In addition, by investigating how health-related communicative action varies across demographics and by media use, this study contributes a range of practical implications in terms of how nonprofit and health communication practitioners might better segment publics and utilize different media channels to disseminate health-related information more effectively.",

We recruited participants via an online panel from the United States and India, and analyzed data from 444 employees. Natural elements and sunlight exposure related positively to job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and negatively to depressed mood and anxiety. Direct sunlight was a dominant predictor of anxiety; indirect sunlight was a dominant predictor of depressed mood, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Natural elements buffered the relationship between role stressors and job satisfaction, depressed mood, and anxiety. We also found that depressed mood partially mediated the relationship between natural elements and job satisfaction. We discuss scientific and policy implications of these findings.",

While it is now clear that imagined contact can improve intergroup attitudes, its ability to change actual intergroup behavior is less well established. Some emerging findings provide cause for optimism with nonverbal, and unobtrusive measures of behavior. This paper extends this work by adopting methods from behavioral economics to examine more deliberative behavior. Participants believed they were playing a prisoner’s dilemma with an outgroup member. They could choose whether to cooperate or compete with the other player. In three studies, we provide reliable evidence that imagined contact (vs. control) successfully encouraged more prosocial, cooperative choices. In the third study we show that this effect is mediated by increased trust towards the outgroup member. The findings demonstrate that imagined contact interventions can have a tangible impact on volitional intergroup behaviors.",

They may have a desire to romantically pursue the new person, while wanting to be faithful to their partner. How do people manage the threat that attractive alternatives present to their relationship goals? We suggest that one way people defend their relationships against attractive individuals is by perceiving the individual as less attractive. In two studies, using a novel visual matching paradigm, we found support for a perceptual downgrading effect. People in relationships perceived threatening attractive individuals as less attractive than did single participants. The effect was exacerbated among participants who were highly satisfied with their current relationships. The studies provide evidence for a perceptual bias that emerges to protect long-term goals. We discuss the findings within the context of a broader theory of motivated perception in the service of self-control.",

While limited self-control is frequently the culprit, another cause is simply forgetting to enact intentions when opportunities arise. We introduce a novel, potent approach to facilitating follow-through: the reminders-through-association approach. This approach involves associating intentions (e.g., to mail a letter on your desk tomorrow) with distinctive cues that will capture attention when you have opportunities to act on those intentions (e.g., Valentine’s Day flowers that arrived late yesterday, which are sitting on your desk). We showed that cue-based reminders are more potent when the cues they employ are distinctive relative to (a) other regularly encountered stimuli and (b) other stimuli encountered concurrently. Further, they can be more effective than written or electronic reminder messages, and they are undervalued and underused. The reminders-through-association approach, developed by integrating and expanding on past research on self-control, reminders, and prospective memory, can be a powerful tool for policymakers and individuals.",

Public health practitioners have noticed the promise and potential of the Internet, however, little is known about individuals' skills of their eHealth literacy. The eHealth Literacy Scale, eHEALS, was designed to measure perceptions of individuals' eHealth literacy skills.Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the psychometric validity and reliability of the eHEALS with two adult populations using the Rasch Model.Methods: A college-aged sample and an Internet-based sample (Amazon's MTurk) were recruited to complete the eHEALS, demographic questions, and a health literacy scale. Using WINSTEPS and SPSS, unidimensionality, item fit, rating scale, item hierarchy, person ability-item match, and reliability were analyzed, compared, and contrasted against each sample and to other samples found in the literature. Results: An exploratory factor analysis supported unidimensionality in both samples. More than 90% of respondents from both samples fit the model. No items were outright misfitting. Both samples separated into three distinct groups. Conclusions: Based on the results, the eHEALS is a reliable and consistent measurement tool for a college sample and an Internet-based sample. As these individuals are most likely to use the Internet as a health resource, it is necessary to learn and know their skills versus perceiving that they can critically and successfully navigate the Internet. Further analyses are necessary to ensure that the eHEALS can serve as a standard eHealth literacy measure for public health.",

Thus, parents may be an important target for eating-disorder research to guide the development of clinical programs.Methods The current study examined differences in child eating-disorder behaviors and parental feeding practices between a sample of parents (42 fathers, 130 mothers) exhibiting core features of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or purging disorder, and a matched sample of parents (n = 172) reporting no eating-disorder characteristics.Results Parents with eating-disorder psychopathology were significantly more likely than parents without eating-disorder characteristics to report child binge-eating and compulsive exercise. Parents with eating-disorder psychopathology reported greater perceived feeding responsibility, greater concern about their child's weight, and more monitoring of their child's eating than parents without eating-disorder characteristics; however, they did not differ significantly in restriction of their child's diet and pressure-to-eat. Child body mass index z-scores did not differ between parents with versus without eating-disorder characteristics.ConclusionOur findings suggest some important differences between parents with and without core eating-disorder psychopathology, which could augment clinical interventions for patients with eating disorders who are parents, or could guide pediatric eating-disorder prevention efforts. However, because our study was cross-sectional, findings could indicate increased awareness of or sensitivity to eating-disorder behaviors rather than a psychosocial cause of those behaviors. Longitudinal research and controlled trials examining prevention and intervention can clarify and address these clinical concerns.",

We evaluate the model performance through automatic evaluation metrics and by carrying out a human evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our model improves upon recently proposed models and that the latent variables facilitate the generation of long outputs and maintain the context.",

People acknowledge that parties serve important functions as they organize the electorate, simplify voter choices, and help voters elect leaders that will carry out their desired policies (Dalton, Farrell, and McAllister 2011). However, other people blame political parties for the increasing polarization and gridlock in our government, and some people claim that individuals rely too heavily on partisan cues and not enough on information about political candidates when determining their vote choice. Because political parties perform such important tasks, we expect individuals to vote differently in the absence of party cues. We use a survey experiment to assess the extent to which the indication of candidates’ partisanship on a hypothetical ballot actually affects vote choice. We randomly assigned participants into two groups. Participants in both groups saw a hypothetical ballot with the two hypothetical presidential candidates with certain qualifications and issue positions, but only those in the experimental group saw the political partisanship of the candidates. We then asked the survey participants to indicate the presidential candidate they would choose. By using the indication of partisanship on the hypothetical ballot as the independent variable in our study, we determined that those who identified with a particular political party voted for their own party’s candidate at a higher rate when partisanship was indicated on the ballot compared to when it was not—even after controlling for a wide range of factors. This experiment allowed us to isolate the independent effect of party labels on determining individuals’ vote choices, which enabled us to understand to what extent individuals are influenced by party cues. We found that even when exposed to the same two candidates, individuals change their voting behavior significantly in the presence of partisan cues, permitting us to infer that party labels still play a tremendous role in our society today.partisan cues, permitting us to infer that party labels still play a tremendous role in our society today.",

Optimal foraging in guided visual search,"KA Ehinger, JM Wolfe","Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics",May,May 2016,http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-016-1128-1,"Suppose that you are looking for visual targets in a set of images, each containing an unknown number of targets. How do you perform that search, and how do you decide when to move from the current image to the next? Optimal foraging theory predicts that foragers should leave the current image when the expected value from staying falls below the expected value from leaving. Here, we describe how to apply these models to more complex tasks, like search for objects in natural scenes where people have prior beliefs about the number and locations of targets in each image, and search is guided by target features and scene context. We model these factors in a guided search task and predict the optimal time to quit search. The data come from a satellite image search task. Participants searched for small gas stations in large satellite images. We model quitting times with a Bayesian model that incorporates prior beliefs about the number of targets in each map, average search efficiency (guidance), and actual search history in the image. Clicks deploying local magnification were used as surrogates for deployments of attention and, thus, for time. Leaving times (measured in mouse clicks) were well-predicted by the model. People terminated search when their expected rate of target collection fell to the average rate for the task. Apparently, people follow a rate-optimizing strategy in this task and use both their prior knowledge and search history in the image to decide when to quit searching.",

Currently 1 in 7 Americans or 47.6 million people receive governmental support to purchase any kind of food as long as it is not alcohol, nutritional supplements, heated food or food served to eat on location. In recent years, policymakers, public health nutritionists and anti-hunger advocates have been engaged in an ongoing discussion about how to modify SNAP policies to maximize its nutritional impact for its beneficiaries. However, SNAP participants and low-income nonparticipants have been missing from this conversation, despite their key stakeholder interests. This online study surveyed 387 individuals from Amazon Mechanical Turk, of whom 118 were SNAP beneficiaries and 269 food-insufficient but not enrolled in SNAP (nonparticipants), on their perspectives of proposed strategies to improve the nutritional impact of SNAP. The majority of all respondents (70%) believed the current benefit level was insufficient to afford a healthy diet. Most SNAP participants (76%) and nonparticipants (81%) supported pairing monetary incentives for fruits and vegetables with restrictions for sugary beverages to be purchased with SNAP benefits. Participants were asked to choose from two hypothetical scenarios: 1) a SNAP program that combined healthy incentives and restrictions for sugary bevera0ges (i.e. SNAP+), or 2) SNAP in its current form. From the whole sample, 67% of SNAP participants and 83% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+. Of those who initially chose SNAP in its current form, 68% of SNAP participants and 64% of nonparticipants would choose SNAP+ if paired with a 50% increase in benefit level. These results show overwhelming support from program participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants for SNAP policies that both facilitate the purchase of healthful foods and limit the purchase of unhealthful foods, specifically sugary beverages. These policies deserve to be studied in pilot projects and may help to alleviate diet-related health disparities in this vulnerable population.",

Objective: Our objective is to validate the use of machine learning algorithms for Twitter data against empirically validated measures of suicidality in the US population. Methods: Using a machine learning algorithm, the Twitter feeds of 135 Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants were compared with validated, self-report measures of suicide risk. Results: Our findings show that people who are at high suicidal risk can be easily differentiated from those who are not by machine learning algorithms, which accurately identify the clinically significant suicidal rate in 92% of cases (sensitivity: 53%, specificity: 97%, positive predictive value: 75%, negative predictive value: 93%). Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms are efficient in differentiating people who are at a suicidal risk from those who are not. Evidence for suicidality can be measured in nonclinical populations using social media data.",

We identify an empirical gap in support for this notion. The theoretical model constrains stereotypes a priori to these 2 dimensions; without this constraint, participants might spontaneously employ other relevant dimensions. We fill this gap by complementing the existing theory-driven approaches with a data-driven approach that allows an estimation of the spontaneously employed dimensions of stereotyping. Seven studies (total N = 4,451) show that people organize social groups primarily based on their agency/socioeconomic success (A), and as a second dimension, based on their conservative-progressive beliefs (B). Communion (C) is not found as a dimension by its own, but rather as an emergent quality in the two-dimensional space of A and B, resulting in a 2D ABC model of stereotype content about social groups.

Some evidence suggests stereotype threat effects are buffered by adoption of performance avoidance goals (Chalabaev, Major, Sarrazin, & Cury, 2012). With 590 American female participants, we closely replicated Chalabaev et al. (2012). Results showed no significant main or interaction effects for stereotype threat or performance avoidance goals, despite multiple controls. We conclude that effects of stereotype threat might be smaller than typically reported and find limited evidence for moderation by avoidance achievement goals. Accordingly, stereotype threat might not be a major part of the explanation for the gender gap in math performance, consistent with recent meta-analyses (Flore & Wicherts, 2015).",

Furthermore, the elevation-inducing stimulus (vs. the control condition) significantly promoted prosocial motivation and this effect was sequentially mediated by feelings of moral elevation followed by an approach-oriented state.

This article introduces a new theoretical framework for understanding when power leads to more versus less unethical behavior. Our key proposition is that people hold expectations about power that are both descriptive (how the powerful do behave) and prescriptive (how the powerful should behave). People hold descriptive beliefs that the powerful do behave more unethically than the powerless, but they hold prescriptive beliefs that the powerful should behave more ethically than the powerless. Whichever expectation—descriptive or prescriptive—is salient affects how power influences one’s behavior. Three experiments demonstrate that activating descriptive expectations for power leads the powerful to cheat more than the powerless, whereas activating prescriptive expectations leads the powerful to cheat less than the powerless. The current work offers new ideas for curbing unethical behavior by those with power: focus their attention on prescriptive expectations for power.",

In this article, we investigate the impact of power on a consumer’s willingness to spread word-of-mouth (WOM) by posting an online review. Drawing on self-enhancement theory, which suggests that an individual is motivated to spread WOM in order to boost his or her self-image, and the agentic versus communal theory of power, we argue that the impact of power is moderated by the valence of the customer’s service experience, and its congruity with that of other forum users. Results from three studies in hotel and restaurant contexts indicate that powerless consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Conversely, powerful consumers are more likely to post positive reviews when the overriding consensus is negative. Further, such results hold only for positive (vs. negative) service experiences. Managerially, our findings suggest that introducing power mechanisms such as influence rankings or helpful votes into online consumer forums may shape review posting behaviors. Service marketers and social media managers need to be aware that some customer segments are not inclined to post positive online reviews. As indicated by our findings, powerful consumers, such as those with high helpful ratings or elite reviewer status, are more likely to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is negative. Conversely, powerless consumers, such as those with low helpful ratings or junior reviewer status, might be more inclined to post positive reviews when the forum consensus is also positive. Based on our findings, we also discussed the theoretical contributions, limitations, and ideas for future research.",

When new information is encountered, these models must be updated or new ones created. Consistent with the event indexing model, previous studies have shown that when readers encounter an event shift, reading times often increase. However, such increases are not consistently observed. This paper addresses this inconsistency by examining the extent to which reading-time differences observed at event shifts reflect an unexpectedness in the narrative rather than processes involved in model updating. In two reassessments of prior work, event shifts known to increase reading time were rated as less expected, and expectedness ratings significantly predicted reading time. In three new experiments, participants read stories in which an event shift was or was not foreshadowed, thereby influencing expectedness of the shift. Experiment 1 revealed that readers do not expect event shifts, but foreshadowing eliminates this. Experiment 2 showed that foreshadowing does not affect identification of event shifts. Finally, Experiment 3 found that, although reading times increased when an event shift was not foreshadowed, they were not different from controls when it was. Moreover, responses to memory probes were slower following an event shift regardless of foreshadowing, suggesting that situation model updating had taken place. Overall, the results support the idea that previously observed reading time increases at event shifts reflect, at least in part, a reader’s unexpected encounter with a shift rather than an increase in processing effort required to update a situation model.",

Adult participants evaluated the relative harm of a Marlboro Red pack versus three different AS packs with the descriptors “Made with Organic Tobacco,” “100% Additive-Free,” or “100% US Grown Tobacco” (Survey 1; n = 461); a Marlboro Red pack versus these AS packs modified to exclude descriptors (Survey 2; n = 857); and unmodified versus modified AS pack images (Survey 3; n = 1001). Results: The majority of Survey 1 participants rated the unmodified AS packs as less harmful than the Marlboro Red pack; 35.4%–58.8% of Survey 2 participants also rated the modified (no claims) packs as less harmful than Marlboro Red. In these surveys, prior use of AS cigarettes was associated with reduced perceptions of risk (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.59–2.40). “Made with Organic Tobacco” and “100% Additive-Free” were associated with reduced perceptions of risk when comparing the modified versus the unmodified AS packs (Survey 3). Conclusions: Data suggest that these AS pack descriptors communicate reduced harm messages to consumers. Findings have implications for regulatory actions related to product labeling and packaging. Implications: These findings provide additional evidence that the “Made with Organic Tobacco,” “100% Additive-Free,” and “100% US Grown” descriptors, as well as other aspects of the AS pack design, communicate reduced harm to non-, current, and former smokers. Additionally, they provide support for the importance of FDA’s 2015 warning to Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company on “100% Additive Free” as an unauthorized modified risk claim.",

An important part of this research is understanding emotion regulation and dysregulation, in particular, how individuals differ in their ability to identify, accept, and manage their emotional experiences. One of the most common and widely cited measures of emotion dysregulation is the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer 2004), which has been extensively used to facilitate understanding of how emotion dysregulation is associated with psychiatric symptoms, other emotion-related constructs, and treatment progress. While this scale has contributed greatly to our understanding of emotion regulation problems, its length makes its inclusion in brief study protocols difficult, limiting its utility and increasing participant burden. In order to address this issue, we developed a short form version of the DERS (DERS-18) composed of the strongest items from each of the measure’s six subscales from the original DERS publication (Gratz and Roemer 2004), and then validated this measure in five datasets that vary in age and sample type. Our results demonstrate that an 18-item short-form of the DERS exhibits a similar structure as the original 36-item DERS, demonstrates excellent reliability and validity, and performs similarly to the original DERS despite comprising half the items. The DERS-18 has the potential to improve and expand emotion regulation assessment while reducing demands on research participants.",

Design/methodology/approach Using recognized scales, consumers’ ontological and aesthetic orientation and attitudes toward luxury wine brands as part of a product category are measured. Data for the USA sample were collected using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, whereas the South African sample data were collected from a sample of Generation Y consumers. Using the two orientation scores, it was possible to create a 2 × 2 matrix with low and high scores for the two countries investigated. To determine the relationship between the resultant groups and attitude toward wine, ANOVA was performed. Differences among the groups were identified via a comparison of means. Findings The results suggest that the use of aesthetics and ontological orientations enables the identification of different luxury wine consumer modes in the two countries studied. In addition, these demonstrate significantly different attitudes toward luxury wine brands as part of a product category. Research limitations/implications The samples for both countries were collected using a non-probability sampling method, and any generalization to the greater populations must be undertaken with caution. Practical implications The findings demonstrate a unique approach that provides an alternative form of segmentation for luxury wine brands. Recommendations to target the different identified modes and how these impact attitudes toward luxury wine brands as a product category in the two countries are made. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by providing a unique and alternative method of market segmentation and shows how this affect attitudes toward luxury wine brands as a product category.",

Thus, through a series of three studies, the research herein examines a new category of attributions—sacred attributions—to determine when consumers make secular versus sacred attributions and how this influences product evaluations. Study 1 shows that religiosity is positively correlated with sacred attributions. Additionally, Study 1 finds that sacred attributions to God are more likely in positive consumption situations, while sacred attributions to Satan are more likely in negative consumption situations. Study 2 finds that God (Satan) attributions lead to positive (negative) product evaluations, and these effects are pervasive, regardless of religious priming. Study 3 increases external validity by using real businesses to show that sacred attributions are greatest for businesses with a sacred value system, although these effects differ based on situational affect. Findings build upon the literature on attribution theory and priming.",

Growing evidence suggests that decreases in delay discounting contribute to healthier preferences. This study sought to provide preliminary evidence for the viability of developing a brief priming task to reduce delay discounting in a large, diverse group of individuals. Participants (n = 1,122) were randomized to one of three conditions: Future Focus (FF), Present Focus (PF), and Non-Temporal Focus (NTF) intended respectively to decrease, increase, or have no effect on delay discounting. Participants then completed the Monetary Choice Questionnaire, a brief assessment of delay discounting rate. Participants randomized to FF exhibited significantly lower discounting rates than those randomized to PF or NTF conditions. Race, Hispanic background, social self-monitoring, education, and cigarette smoking also accounted for a significant amount of variance in the discounting model. These findings provide support for the development of a brief priming intervention that might be examined in clinical or public health contexts to decrease discounting and support healthy choices.",

The current work tests a new approach, inquiring whether lay people's views about IP protection can be modified by arguments concerning the basis for IP rights. Across 2 experiments, 572 adults (recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk) read 1 of 6 arguments about the basis for IP protection (incentives, natural rights, expressive rights, plagiarism, commons, or no argument). Participants then reported their general support for IP protection. Participants also reported their evaluations of 2 scenarios that involved infringement of IP rights, including cases in which there were mitigating experiences (e.g., the copier acknowledged the original source), and completed several demographic questions. Three primary findings emerged: (a) exposure to the importance of the public commons (and to a lesser extent, exposure to the argument that plagiarism is the basis of IP protection) led participants to become less supportive of IP protection than the incentives, natural rights, expressive rights, and control conditions; (b) people believed that infringement was more acceptable if the infringer acknowledged the original creator of the work; and (c) older adults and women were especially likely to see infringement as problematic. These findings illustrate several ways in which lay beliefs are at odds with legal doctrine, and suggest that people's views about IP protection can be shaped in certain ways by learning the basis for IP rights.",

Several papers have been published on the problem of visual emotion analysis. In particular, attempts have been made to analyze and predict people’s emotional reaction towards images. To this end, different kinds of hand-tuned features are proposed. The results reported on several carefully selected and labeled small image data sets have confirmed the promise of such features. While the recent successes of many computer vision related tasks are due to the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), visual emotion analysis has not achieved the same level of success. This may be primarily due to the unavailability of confidently labeled and relatively large image data sets for visual emotion analysis. In this work, we introduce a new data set, which started from 3+ million weakly labeled images of different emotions and ended up 30 times as large as the current largest publicly available visual emotion data set. We hope that this data set encourages further research on visual emotion analysis. We also perform extensive benchmarking analyses on this large data set using the state of the art methods including CNNs.",

For example, individuals are more likely to check their tyre pressure when prompted with self-transcendent (that is, benefits to the environment) versus economic motives1; and, self-transcendent appeals are more likely to promote recycling behaviours than self-interested appeals2. The present experiments identify an important psychological factor that helps to explain when highlighting economic benefits will be more or less effective in encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. Specifically, we demonstrate that highlighting economic benefits (for example, the money a consumer can save) reduces consumer interest in sustainable products when individuals are in more abstract mindsets compared with when the evaluation is more immediate (that is, their mindset is more concrete). Further, we provide evidence that this shift in interest is driven by the lack of ‘fit’ between abstract thinking and economic motivations, in the context of pro-environmental behaviour.",

The present research investigates the complementary question: How places derive affective meaning from the surroundings. In six experiments we showed how the appraisal of target places changed when the surroundings contained a negatively valenced location. In accordance with a model of affective judgment in spatial context that combines the inclusion/exclusion model of assimilation and contrast and range theory, places were either negatively or positively affected. The specific effect depended on the negatively valenced location’s gradient of influence and on the size of the chunk of environment people considered for their judgment.

The symmetric SBM generates a graph with 2n nodes which cluster into two equally sized communities. Nodes connect with probability p within a community and q across different communities. We consider the case of p = a ln(n)/n and q = b ln(n)/n. In this case, it was recently shown that recovering the community membership (or label) of every node with high probability (w.h.p.) using only the graph is possible if and only if the Chernoff-Hellinger (CH) divergence D(a, b) = (√ a − √ b) 2 ≥ 1. In this work, we study if, and by how much, community detection below the clustering threshold (i.e. D(a, b) < 1) is possible by querying the labels of a limited number of chosen nodes (i.e., active learning). Our main result is to show that, under certain conditions, sampling the labels of a vanishingly small fraction of nodes (a number sub-linear in n) is sufficient for exact community detection even when D(a, b) < 1. Furthermore, we provide an efficient learning algorithm which recovers the community memberships of all nodes w.h.p. as long as the number of sampled points meets the sufficient condition. We also show that recovery is not possible if the number of observed labels is less than n 1−D(a,b) . The validity of our results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.",

Regression analysis indicated that more stressful life events and greater perceived stress predicted belief in conspiracy theories once effects of social status and age were accounted for (Adj.

It is widely assumed that emphasizing personal responsibility for climate change is effective at increasing pro-climate behavior whereas collectively framing the causes of climate change diffuses responsibility and dampens the incentive for individual action. We observe the opposite result. Here we find, across three experiments, that emphasizing collective responsibility for the causes of climate change increases pro-climate monetary donations by approximately 7 % in environmental group members and by 50 % in the general public. Further, highlighting collective responsibility amplifies intent to reduce future carbon emissions. In contrast, focusing on personal responsibility for climate change does not significantly alter donations to climate change advocacy or the intent for future pro-climate behavior.

Individuals facing difficult decisions often rely on heuristics, such as anchoring, which predictably bias decision outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether showing a larger historical Heartmate XVE creates an anchoring effect, making the smaller Heartmate II (HMII) appear more favorable. Methods With the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk, participants watched videos asking them to imagine themselves dying of end-stage heart failure, then were presented the option of LVAD as potentially life-prolonging therapy. Participants were randomized to a control group who were only shown the HMII device, and the intervention group who saw the XVE device before the HMII. Participants then completed surveys. Results A total of 487 participants completed the survey (control = 252; intervention = 235); 79% were <40 years of age, 84% were white, and 55% were male. The intervention group was not more likely to accept the LVAD therapy (68% vs 61%; P = .37). However, participants in the intervention group were more likely (51% vs 17%; P < .01) to agree or strongly agree with the statement that the HMII was “smaller than expected.” Participants in the intervention group were also more likely to rate the size of the device as “important” or “very important” in their decision (61% vs 46%; P < .01). Conclusions Although the XVE anchor did not affect likelihood of accepting the LVAD, it did affect device perception. This article highlights an important point with clinical implications: factors such as anchoring have the potential to inappropriately influence perceptions and decisions and should be carefully considered in research and practice.",

HKV argue that this pattern of results supports a quantifier-raising (QR) analysis of both ACD structures and quantified NPs in object position: under the account that they advocate, both ACD resolution and quantified NPs in object position require movement of the object NP to a higher syntactic position. The processing advantage for quantified object NPs in ACD is hypothesized to derive from the fact that – at the point where ACD resolution must take place – the quantified NP has already undergone QR whereas this is not the case for definite NPs. Here, we report attempted replications of their self-paced reading Experiments 1 and 2. We do not replicate the critical interactions in any of the words immediately following the disambiguating verb in either experiment. Putting these observations together with the observation that it was only post-hoc analysis decisions that were responsible for HKV's observed effects in the first place (Gibson et al., submitted), we conclude that the experiments reported by HKV should not be viewed as providing evidence for the ACD quantifier raising processing effect.",

Most public respondents were <45yr (70%), had some College/University education (85%), and had never done AR (92%).

Asked about benefits from AR, most thought that there are sometimes or often large benefits to humans from AR. Asked about expectations of translation to humans (of toxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and treatment findings in the animal 'models'), most expect: translation to humans over 60% of the time, and misleading AR findings <41% of the time. If translation was to occur <20% of the time, only a minority disagreed that this would ""significantly reduce your support for AR"".

Most public respondents were <45yr (65%), had some College/University education (83%), and had never done AR (92%). Most of the public and medical students considered 'benefits arguments' sufficient to justify AR; however, most acknowledged that counterarguments suggesting alternative research methods may be available, or that it is unclear why the same 'benefits arguments' do not apply to using humans in research, significantly weakened 'benefits arguments'. Almost all were not convinced of the moral permissibility of AR by 'things about non-human-animals arguments', including that non-human-animals may not be sentient, or are property. Most were not convinced of the moral permissibility of AR by 'human exceptionalism' arguments, including that humans have more advanced mental abilities, are of a special 'kind', can enter into social contracts, or face a 'lifeboat situation'. Counterarguments explained much of this, including the 'argument from species overlap' ['Not all humans have these abilities. Babies, infants, and severely brain damaged children or adults (for example, with very advanced Alzheimer's) do not have these abilities. Some animals may have more abilities than these humans'], that the notion of 'kind' is arbitrary [why are we not of the 'kind' 'sentient-animal' or 'subject-of-a-life'?], and that this may be a form of prejudice [ '...in the past this argument was used to justify prejudice (for example, slavery) against those we cared less about, who were considered not of our own kind']. Medical students were more supportive (80%) of AR even at the end of the survey (p<0.05).

In this contribution, bullshit is used as a technical term which is defined as communicative expression that lacks content, logic, or truth from the perspective of natural science. We used the Bullshit Receptivity scale (BSR) to measure seeing profoundness in bullshit statements. The BSR scale contains statements that have a correct syntactic structure and seem to be sound and meaningful on first reading but are actually vacuous. Participants (N = 196; obtained via Amazon Mechanical Turk) rated the profoundness of bullshit statements (using the BSR) and provided favorability ratings of three Democratic (Hillary Clinton, Martin O’Malley, and Bernie Sanders) and three Republican candidates for US president (Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump). Participants also completed a measure of political liberalism/conservatism. Results revealed that favorable views of all three Republican candidates were positively related to judging bullshit statements as profound. The smallest correlation was found for Donald Trump. Although we observe a positive association between bullshit and support for the three Democrat candidates, this relationship is both substantively small and statistically insignificant. The general measure of political liberalism/conservatism was also related to judging bullshit statements as profound in that individuals who were more politically conservative had a higher tendency to see profoundness in bullshit statements. Of note, these results were not due to a general tendency among conservatives to see profoundness in everything: Favorable views of Republican candidates and conservatism were not significantly related to profoundness ratings of mundane statements. In contrast, this was the case for Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley. Overall, small-to-medium sized correlations were found, indicating that far from all conservatives see profoundness in bullshit statements.",

Since public opinion affects the policy choices of government, we investigate how arguments regarding carbon offsetting's economic efficiency, effectiveness, and ethicality, which have been key points in the public debate, impact the public's preferences. We fielded an online framing experiment in the United States (N=995) to empirically identify how arguments for and against carbon offsetting influence public preferences for the inclusion of offsetting in national GHG mitigation policy. We find that the public's support for international offsetting increases and support for reductions at their source (i.e. within firms' own operations) diminishes when considerations of economic efficiency gains are at the forefront. Support for offsetting declines when individuals are confronted with arguments concerning its effectiveness and ethicality, which suggests that future policies will require clear standards of additionality in order to address these concerns. Moreover, we find that how carbon offsetting is framed matters even amongst climate skeptics and support could potentially be enhanced via improved communication on efficiency gains.",

The authors focus primarily on uncovering the causal mechanism in which such effect is mediated by warmth stereotype Design/methodology/approach The authors used data collected from experiments and field surveys in the USA and South Korea. Findings Pilot study shows that an anonymous person against a warm color background (vs neutral and cold color background) is perceived to be one with warmer personality. Study 1 shows that warm (vs neutral) color in advertising increases a perceiver’s warmth stereotype and trust and, consequently, a favorable attitude toward the advertiser. Study 2 shows that color-based warmth of an e-commerce website increases a web user’s warmth stereotype and trust of the website and higher intention to purchase. Study 3 shows that the nurses’ perception of warmth from a hospital’s ambient color affects their favorable judgment of the hospital and intention to take on an extra role. Importantly, all effects observed across studies were mediated by the activation of warmth stereotype. Practical implications The findings provide practical guidelines to companies for the usage of colors in crafting advertising artifacts, designing a website and creating a workplace environment to induce positive attitudes and motivations toward each target. Originality/value The extant research on warmth experiences focuses on tactile sensation as a key independent variable and transient mood as a dominant mediator. This study extends the stream of research by adopting perceived visual sensation as an independent variable and warmth stereotype as a new mediating construct.",

Design/methodology/approach Two experimental studies in the restaurant context demonstrate the backfire effect. A boundary condition of the effect as well as the underlying psychological process are identified. Findings Consumers respond adversely to coupons with restrictive requirements for redemption – in particular, a short duration. Study 1 indicates that while a short-duration (vs long-duration) coupon may backfire when its face value is low, this backfire effect is attenuated when the coupon’s face value is high. Furthermore, Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence that psychological reactance is the process underlying this backfire effect. Originality/value Consumers respond negatively to coupons with restrictive requirements for redemption because they perceive them as a company’s attempt to limit their freedom of choice. Companies should take measures, including careful target marketing, to avoid rousing this reaction from their consumers.",

This study aims to assess users’ knowledge of security warnings communicated via browser indicators and the likelihood that their online decision-making adheres to this knowledge. Design/methodology/approach Participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk visited a series of secure and insecure websites and decided as quickly and as accurately as possible whether it was safe to login. An online survey was then used to assess their knowledge of information security. Findings Knowledge of information security was not necessarily a good predictor of decisions regarding whether to sign-in to a website. Moreover, these decisions were modulated by attention to security indicators, familiarity of the website and psychosocial stress induced by bonus payments determined by response times and accuracy. Practical implications Even individuals with security knowledge are unable to draw the necessary conclusions about digital risks when browsing the web. Users are being educated through daily use to ignore recommended security indicators. Originality/value This study represents a new way to entice participants into risky behavior by monetizing both speed and accuracy. This approach could be broadly useful as a way to study risky environments without placing participants at risk.",

The goal of the present study was to test whether individuals within a subculture with long-standing norms of affirmative consent—the bondage and discipline/dominance and submission/sadism and masochism (BDSM) community—report lower rape-supportive attitudes compared to individuals not from within this subculture. BDSM practitioner participants, adult participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and college student participants completed measures of hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, rape myth acceptance, victim blaming, expectation of sexual aggression, and acceptance of sexual aggression. BDSM practitioners reported significantly lower levels of benevolent sexism, rape myth acceptance, and victim blaming than did college undergraduates and adult MTurk workers. BDSM practitioners did not differ significantly from college undergraduates or adult MTurk workers on measures of hostile sexism, expectations of sexual aggression, or acceptance of sexual aggression.

Recently, this finding was challenged by Firestone and Scholl (Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 2014), who argued that the nominal illusion remained even when the faces were blurred so as to make their race undetectable, and concluded that uncontrolled perceptual differences between the stimulus faces drove at least some observations of the original distortion effect. In this paper we report that measures of race perception used by Firestone and Scholl were insufficiently sensitive. We demonstrate that a forced choice race-identification task not only reveals that participants could detect the race of the blurred faces but also that participants’ lightness judgments often aligned with their assignment of race.",

The CAS represents the sustained use of self-regulating strategies, such as rumination and worry, and beliefs individuals hold about such strategies. Using a sample of community adults located in the United States (N = 226), we found that the CAS was positively associated with sleep difficulties. The association remained intact after controlling for demographic variables, physical health, and negative affect. We further found that self-regulating strategies may be the component of the CAS that is most important to sleep disturbances. Future experimental studies are needed to elucidate whether there exists a causal, and potentially bidirectional, link between the CAS and sleep difficulties.",

The dominant theoretical perspective, rooted in the resource model of self-regulation, suggests that depletion should impair intellectual performance. However, an alternative account, the process model of self-regulation, predicts an improvement. These two theories are tested by manipulating depletion and then exposing participants (N = 326) to an educational digital media application. The findings show support for both models, and propose a new model of ego depletion effects in digital media environments. Depleted participants reported higher levels of media enjoyment, which in turn predicted higher scores on a test of intellectual performance. This indirect effect was strongest among participants low in need for cognition. The findings make important theoretical and practical contributions that may be used as a springboard for future investigations, which are discussed.",

The current studies examined how recalling a vivid experience associated with mortality relates to outcomes indicative of authentic engagement. In Study 1, participants described an experience that made them think about their mortality, indicated how vivid their recollection was, and completed measures of authenticity and goal-pursuit. Results indicated that how vividly a mortality experience was recalled predicted greater authenticity and more important goal-pursuits. Study 2 replicated many of the findings and found a similar pattern when individuals vividly recalled a mortality experience of a close other. Study 3 again replicated these results after controlling for a host of death-related variables. Exploratory analyses further revealed that ruminating about death was often negatively associated with authenticity. Implications for the role of death-related thoughts in authentic and alienated becoming are discussed.",

We also separated introspection in response to cues (e.g., self-reporting craving and affect) from cue exposure alone, to determine if introspection changes behavioral responses to cigarette cues. Finally, we included measures of quit motivation and resistance to smoking to assess motivational influences on cue exposure. Smokers were invited to participate in an online cue-reactivity study. Participants were randomly assigned to view smoking images or neutral images, and were randomized to respond to cues with either craving and affect questions (e.g., introspection) or filler questions. Following cue exposure, participants completed a delay discounting task and then reported state affect, craving, and resistance to smoking, as well as an assessment of quit motivation. We found that after controlling for trait impulsivity, participants who introspected on craving and affect showed higher delay discounting, irrespective of cue type, but we found no effect of response condition on subsequent craving (e.g., craving reactivity). We also found that motivation to quit interacted with experimental conditions to predict state craving and state resistance to smoking. Although asking about craving during cue exposure did not increase later craving, it resulted in greater delaying of discounted rewards. Overall, our findings suggest the need to further assess the implications of introspection and motivation on behavioral outcomes of cue exposure.",
,,,,160,Thinking about a limited future enhances the positivity of younger and older adults' recall: Support for socioemotional selectivity theory,"SJ Barber, PC Opitz, B Martins, M Sakaki, M Mather",Memory & Cognition,April,April 2016,http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-016-0612-0,"Compared with younger adults, older adults have a relative preference to attend to and remember positive over negative information. This is known as the “positivity effect,” and researchers have typically evoked socioemotional selectivity theory to explain it. According to socioemotional selectivity theory, as people get older they begin to perceive their time left in life as more limited. These reduced time horizons prompt older adults to prioritize achieving emotional gratification and thus exhibit increased positivity in attention and recall. Although this is the most commonly cited explanation of the positivity effect, there is currently a lack of clear experimental evidence demonstrating a link between time horizons and positivity. The goal of the current research was to address this issue. In two separate experiments, we asked participants to complete a writing activity, which directed them to think of time as being either limited or expansive (Experiments 1 and 2) or did not orient them to think about time in a particular manner (Experiment 2). Participants were then shown a series of emotional pictures, which they subsequently tried to recall. Results from both studies showed that regardless of chronological age, thinking about a limited future enhanced the relative positivity of participants’ recall. Furthermore, the results of Experiment 2 showed that this effect was not driven by changes in mood. Thus, the fact that older adults’ recall is typically more positive than younger adults’ recall may index naturally shifting time horizons and goals with age.",

Drawing on theories of gender roles and stereotypes, we show that women, relative to men, prefer to enter smaller compared with larger competitions. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrate this effect in observational data on preferences for working in differently sized firms and applying to differently sized colleges. Studies 2a and 2b replicate the effect with real behavioral decisions in different domains. We also find empirical evidence that prescriptive gender norms and stereotypes underlie this effect. In Study 3, we find experimental evidence that women and men differ in their preferences for differently sized groups under competition, but not in noncompetitive settings. Three additional experimental studies (Studies 4, 5a, and 5b) show that perceptions of comfort in small versus larger competitions underlie women’s preferences. These findings suggest that women’s preferences for smaller competitions may be driven by an adherence to prescriptive gender norms. We discuss the implications of the current findings for gender inequalities in organizations.",

In Study 1, we find that systems thinkers tend to believe in scientific consensus, recognize risks posed by climate change, and support policy interventions to address climate change; systems thinking was negatively related to conspiracist and free-market ideation. In Studies 2 and 3 we find that systems thinkers ascribe more value to the natural world — both in monetary terms as well as on social and ecological grounds. The findings suggest that models of environmental cognition can be improved by measuring peoples' tendency to engage in systems thinking.",

Data collected at Time 1 demonstrated that the job characteristics of autonomy support and competence support had direct and interactive effects on employees’ need satisfaction. Need satisfaction at Time 1 mediated the relationship between autonomy support and self-determined work motivation at Time 2. Work motivation, in turn, mediated the relationships between need fulfillment and career attitudes that characterize subjective career success. These findings are theoretically important because they demonstrate that SDT can bridge job design theory and career theory, pointing to new ways that job and career experiences are interrelated. From a practical standpoint, the results are valuable because they show that job enrichment efforts guided by SDT have important implications for promoting career success perceptions and vocational retention among experienced workers.",

We call this type of ontology a single-viewpoint ontology. There can be a variety of such single viewpoint ontologies that represent a wide spectrum of subfields and expert opinions on the domain. However, to have a complete formal vocabulary for the domain they need to be linked and unified into a multiviewpoint model while having the subjective viewpoint statements marked and distinguished from the objectively true statements. In this study, we propose and implement a two-phase methodology for multiviewpoint ontology construction by nonexpert users. The proposed methodology was implemented for the domain of the effect of diet on health. A large-scale crowdsourcing experiment was conducted with about 750 ontological statements to determine whether each of these statements is objectively true, viewpoint, or erroneous. Typically, in crowdsourcing experiments the workers are asked for their personal opinions on the given subject. However, in our case their ability to objectively assess others' opinions was examined as well. Our results show substantially higher accuracy in classification for the objective assessment approach compared to the results based on personal opinions.",

Since in-person care often falls short of meeting the global need of perinatal women, Internet interventions may function as an alternate to help women who currently lack adequate access to face-to-face psychological resources. However, at present there are insufficient empirically supported Internet-based resources for perinatal women. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the relative efficacy of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to a novel Internet-based compassionate mind training approach (CMT) across measures of affect, self-reassurance, self-criticizing, self-attacking, self-compassion, depression, and anxiety. While CBT has been tested and has some support as an Internet tool for perinatal women, this is the first trial to look at CMT for perinatal women over the Internet. METHODS: Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and professional networks. Following completion of demographic items, participants were randomly assigned to either the CBT or CMT condition. Each condition consisted of 45-minute interactive didactic and follow-up exercises to be completed over the course of two weeks. RESULTS:  Post course data was gathered at two weeks. A 2x2 repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to analyze differences between conditions at post course. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of the trial will be discussed as well as the strengths and limitations of MTurk as a tool for recruitment. We will also briefly introduce the future directions along this same line of research.",

The ability to use cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves reinterpreting an initial appraisal to change its emotional impact, could be a protective factor against the health consequences of stress reactivity. The present study investigated (a) if cognitive reappraisal ability (CRA) acts as a stress buffer against a body mass index (BMI) indicative of being overweight (≥25 kg/m2) or obese (≥30 kg/m2), and (b) if this buffering effect persists against the indirect influences of perceived stress reactivity (PSR) on Type 2 diabetes. METHOD: One hundred fifty participants (54% female; mean age = 40.4 years ± 12.4 years) completed an online CRA task, self-report measures of PSR, height, weight, and Type 2 diabetes diagnosis on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. RESULTS: Results revealed that CRA significantly interacted with PSR to predict BMI, which indirectly predicted Type 2 diabetes. Individuals with higher PSR and higher CRA exhibited BMIs within a normal weight range and lower incidence of Type 2 diabetes. In contrast, individuals with higher PSR and lower CRA were overweight or obese, with a higher incidence of Type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, higher CRA was not protective in those who had lower levels of PSR. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that emotion regulation interventions can be developed to indirectly target Type 2 diabetes and similar obesity-related illnesses, and that emotion regulation interventions should be tailored to the individual.

Despite the relative success of CBT for treating substance use disorders, effective human laboratory models of CBT are lacking. Recent reports have indicated that the regulation of craving (ROC) task provides a valid model of craving regulation for nicotine, alcohol, and methamphetamine use. The present study examined ROC in an online sample of regular cocaine users (n = 44) recruited from Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk. In the ROC task, cognitive regulation strategies were manipulated by instructing participants to think about either the positive or negative consequences of consuming cocaine. Participants were then presented with cocaine images while engaging in each cognitive regulation strategy and asked to report current craving that was then compared to neutral look conditions. Food images served as a control. A cocaine purchase task was also completed to assess economic demand for cocaine and its relationship with cocaine craving. The use of negative appraisal strategies that model those used in CBT significantly attenuated craving for cocaine. Cocaine craving was also stimulus-specific, with greater smoked cocaine craving reported by individuals with a history of smoked cocaine use. This online extension of the ROC task provides converging evidence for its use as a model of CBT cocaine-craving regulation. Futures studies can use this model to examine the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of CBT for cocaine use and the relationship between craving regulation and drug-use behavior.

Prior research showed that children did not use sample diversity in evidence selection tasks, indiscriminately choosing diverse or narrow sets (tiger–mouse; tiger–lion) to learn about animals. This failure is not due to a general deficit of inductive reasoning, but reflects children's belief about the category and property at test. Five- to 7 year-olds' inductive reasoning (n = 65) was tested in two categories (animal, people) and properties (toy preference, biological property). As stated earlier, children ignored diverse evidence when learning about animals' biological properties. When learning about people's toy preferences, however, children selected the diverse samples, providing the most compelling evidence to date of spontaneous selection of diverse evidence.",

However, the extent to which processes underlying OCD interfere with mindfulness has not been examined. Limited research has examined neuropsychological functions as mechanisms to explain different levels of mindfulness across individuals. Research in OCD highlights impairment in visual/spatial working memory as possible unique deficits; these and other components of executive functioning may also be important for mindfulness. Participants (N = 103) exceeding clinical cutoffs on measures of OCD, depressive, or generalized anxiety symptoms, or were healthy controls, completed a self-report measure of mindfulness and computerized measures of working memory and cognitive inhibition. Results demonstrated the OCD group scored significantly lower than the anxiety and control groups on some facets of mindfulness. The OCD group performed significantly worse on visual but not spatial working memory compared to verbal working memory. Additionally, the OCD group showed significantly poorer performance on all working memory tasks compared to the control group but not in comparison to other groups. There were no significant differences between the OCD group and the depression group on any measure. Finally, regression models examining working memory and cognitive inhibition as predictors of mindfulness found some support for two of the five facets of mindfulness, though the individual predictors were not significant. Implications are discussed in the context of mindfulness and executive functioning in OCD in terms of future research and treatment.",

By presenting annotation tasks to both pharmacy experts and relatively naïve participants, we hoped to demonstrate the feasibility of using nonexpert annotators for drug-drug information annotation. We were also interested in exploring whether and to what extent natural language processing (NLP) preannotation helped improve task completion time, accuracy, and subjective satisfaction. Methods: Two experts and 4 nonexperts were asked to annotate 208 structured product label sections under 4 conditions completed sequentially: (1) no NLP assistance, (2) preannotation of drug mentions, (3) preannotation of drug mentions and PDDIs, and (4) a repeat of the no-annotation condition. Results were evaluated within the 2 groups and relative to an existing gold standard. Participants were asked to provide reports on the time required to complete tasks and their perceptions of task difficulty. Results: One of the experts and 3 of the nonexperts completed all tasks. Annotation results from the nonexpert group were relatively strong in every scenario and better than the performance of the NLP pipeline. The expert and 2 of the nonexperts were able to complete most tasks in less than 3 hours. Usability perceptions were generally positive (3.67 for expert, mean of 3.33 for nonexperts). Conclusions: The results suggest that nonexpert annotation might be a feasible option for comprehensive labeling of annotated PDDIs across a broader range of drug product labels. Preannotation of drug mentions may ease the annotation task. However, preannotation of PDDIs, as operationalized in this study, presented the participants with difficulties. Future work should test if these issues can be addressed by the use of better performing NLP and a different approach to presenting the PDDI preannotations to users during the annotation workflow.",

Recent evidence indicates that well-being indicators belonging to different categories can be explained by single “general” factor of well-being (e.g. Jovanović, 2015). We further test this hypothesis using a recent well-being scale, which includes indicators of positive feeling and positive functioning (Huppert & So, 2013). While the authors of the scale originally identified a two-factor structure, in view of recent evidence, we hypothesize that the two-factor solution may be due to a method effect of different items being measured with different rating scales. In study 1, we use data from the European Social Survey round 3 (n = 41,461) and find that two factors have poor discriminant validity and, after using a bifactor model to account for different rating scales, only the general factor is reliable. In study 2, we eliminate method effects by using the same rating scale across items, recruit a new sample (n = 507), and find that a one-factor model fits the data well. The results support the hypothesis that well-being indicators, typically categorized as “positive feeling” and “positive functioning,” reflect a single general factor.",

Within a category, however, some exemplars are more representative of that concept than others. Despite long-standing behavioral effects, little is known about how typicality influences the neural representation of real-world objects from the same category. Using fMRI, we showed participants 64 subordinate object categories (exemplars) grouped into 8 basic categories. Typicality for each exemplar was assessed behaviorally and we used several multi-voxel pattern analyses to characterize how typicality affects the pattern of responses elicited in early visual and object-selective areas: V1, V2, V3v, hV4, LOC. We found that in LOC, but not in early areas, typical exemplars elicited activity more similar to the central category tendency and created sharper category boundaries than less typical exemplars, suggesting that typicality enhances within-category similarity and between-category dissimilarity. Additionally, we uncovered a brain region (cIPL) where category boundaries favor less typical categories. Our results suggest that typicality may constitute a previously unexplored principle of organization for intra-category neural structure and, furthermore, that this representation is not directly reflected in image features describing natural input, but rather built by the visual system at an intermediate processing stage.",

Across Study 1 (n = 259) and Study 2 (n = 300), we employed new Euclidean measures able to capture preference fulfillment and compute estimates of mate value discrepancies. Relationship satisfaction was not related to how well mates fulfilled their partner's preferences. Mate value discrepancies, in contrast, interacted to predict relationship satisfaction: relationship satisfaction declined for participants whose mates were less desirable than their alternatives, but only for participants who were higher in mate value than their mates. Additionally, these satisfaction differences mediated a relationship between mate value discrepancies and mate retention behavior. This mediation pathway is unique to satisfaction; the same pathway was not observed through trust, a functionally distinct relationship affective state. Study 3 (n = 301) addressed a methodological limitation of Studies 1 and 2. We replicated the mate value discrepancy interaction to predict relationship satisfaction, but found an effect of ideal preference fulfillment on relationship satisfaction. These results provide evidence that mate preferences have important, functionally specific effects on within-relationship processes through contributing to two independent discrepancy variables: partner–self and partner-potential mate value discrepancies. They also largely contravene the hypothesis that mate preference fulfillment is the key to relationship satisfaction.",

Drawing on motivational frameworks, we theorized that shame-proneness should be wholly problematic for self-forgiveness, whereas some aspects of guilt-proneness may be adaptive. Consistent with this framework, across both community (n = 502) and college (n = 153) samples, guilt-proneness was positively associated with trait self-forgiveness, whereas shame-proneness was negatively associated. Models decomposing guilt- and shame-proneness further supported our framework, with key results replicating across samples. For guilt-proneness, a tendency to make negative behavior evaluations predicted self-forgiveness, but only indirectly via motivational tendencies. For shame-proneness, a tendency to make negative self-evaluations predicted decreased self-forgiveness largely directly. Together, results frame guilt-proneness as potentially beneficial for self-forgiveness, but only to the extent that its motivational characteristics are activated; shame-proneness was broadly negatively related to self-forgiveness.

Often people struggle as to how; and perhaps even more so when the feedback receiver comes from a different culture . Building on the regulatory fit theory, the current research examined how negative feedback framing (gain- vs. loss framed) would affect feedback receivers’ motivation as a function of their regulatory focus. We found that European Americans were in general more promotion-focused than Chinese (Study 1) and Indians (Study 2), such that promotion-focused (vs. prevention-focused) participants showed higher motivation after receiving gain-framed (vs. loss-framed) negative feedback. Across two studies, with student and work samples, our findings answered the question of how to give more effective negative feedback and suggested that regulatory fit can be a universal strategy for increasing motivation across the East and West.",

The perceived risk involved in a scenario and the precise wording of a question can bias the outcome of a study in ways that the experimenter did not intend. This chapter presents the lessons we have learned about trust while conducting human-robot experiments with 770 human subjects. We discuss our work developing narratives that describe trust situations as well as interactive human-robot simulations. These experimental paradigms have guided our research exploring the meaning of trust, trust loss, and trust repair. By using crowdsourcing to locate and manage experiment participants, considerable diversity of opinion is found; there are, however, several considerations that must be included. Conclusions drawn from these experiments demonstrate the types of biases that participants are prone to as well as techniques for mitigating these biases.",

A growing literature supports sound symbolism, or the existence of consistent, intuitive relationships between speech sounds and specific concepts. Prior work establishes that these sound-to-meaning mappings can shape language-related judgments and decisions, but do their effects generalize beyond merely the linguistic and truly color how we navigate our environment? We examine this possibility, relating a predominant sound symbolic distinction (vowel frontness) to a novel associate (spatial proximity) in five studies. We show that changing one vowel in a label can influence estimations of distance, impacting judgment, perception, and action. The results (1) provide the first experimental support for a relationship between vowels and spatial distance and (2) demonstrate that sound-to-meaning mappings have outcomes that extend beyond just language and can – through a single sound – influence how we perceive and behave toward objects in the world.",

Tool development is guided by a data-driven feature analysis comparing simple and difficult text. In the present study, we focus on the common advice to split long noun phrases. Our previous corpus analysis showed that easier texts contained shorter noun phrases. Subsequently, we conducted a user study to measure the difficulty of sentences containing noun phrases of different lengths (2-gram, 3-gram, and 4-gram); noun phrases of different conditions (split or not); and, to simulate unknown terms, pseudowords (present or not). We gathered 35 evaluations for 30 sentences in each condition (3 × 2 × 2 conditions) on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (N = 12,600). We conducted a 3-way analysis of variance for perceived and actual difficulty. Splitting noun phrases had a positive effect on perceived difficulty but a negative effect on actual difficulty. The presence of pseudowords increased perceived and actual difficulty. Without pseudowords, longer noun phrases led to increased perceived and actual difficulty. A follow-up study using the phrases (N = 1,350) showed that measuring awkwardness may indicate when to split noun phrases. We conclude that splitting noun phrases benefits perceived difficulty but hurts actual difficulty when the phrasing becomes less natural.",

On the basis of qualitative and quantitative research, we first develop a scale of sharing motives, showing that the reasons for participating in online sharing platforms are more nuanced than previously thought. Second, employing a motivational model of sharing, rooted in the theory of planned behavior, we show that sharing attitudes are driven by moral, social-hedonic and monetary motivations. Furthermore, we identify materialism, sociability and volunteering as predictors of sharing motives in different sharing contexts. Against this background, we explore the possible role of monetary incentives as a necessary but not sufficient condition for sharing one's possessions with others.",

Consequently, this study had 2 goals: (a) to examine the Wender Utah Rating Scale's structure, and (b) to explicate the construct validity of this measure by relating factors from our structural analyses to other ADHD, psychopathology, and personality measures. Structural analyses in an adult community sample (N = 294) yielded a 3-factor structure of aggression (e.g., angry), internalizing distress (e.g., depressed), and academic difficulties (e.g., underachiever). Correlational and regression analyses indicated that these factors failed to display specificity in their associations with ADHD versus other psychopathology. Aggression and internalizing distress associated most strongly with indicators of externalizing (e.g., ill temper, manipulativeness) and internalizing psychopathology (e.g., depression, anxiety), respectively. Academic difficulties associated most strongly with ADHD symptoms, but these relations were relatively weak. Taken together, these findings raise concerns about the Wender Utah Rating Scale's construct validity, although additional longitudinal research is needed to clarify to what extent the Wender Utah Rating Scale validly assesses childhood ADHD symptoms.",

To explore this question, data were collected from 196 participants (age 18–40), split evenly between men and women. Participants narrated four memories, a neutral event, high point event, low point event, and self-defining memory, completed ratings of emotional intensity for each event, and completed four measures of gender typical identity. For self-reported emotional intensity, gender differences in AM were mediated by identification with stereotypical feminine gender norms. For narrative use of affect terms, both gender and gender typical identity predicted affective expression. The results confirm contextual models of gender identity (e.g., Diamond,2012. The desire disorder in research on sexual orientation in women: Contributions of dynamical systems theory.

Employing the Goldberg paradigm, participants read identical leadership speeches attributed to either a woman or a man described as either a minority (Black or Latino/a) or a majority (White) group member. Results show social dominance orientation negatively predicted evaluations of minority and female leaders and patriotism positively predicted evaluations of White leaders.",

Computer vision has a great potential to help our daily lives by searching for lost keys, watering flowers or reminding us to take a pill. To succeed with such tasks, computer vision methods need to be trained from real and diverse examples of our daily dynamic scenes. While most of such scenes are not particularly exciting, they typically do not appear on YouTube, in movies or TV broadcasts. So how do we collect sufficiently many diverse but boring samples representing our lives? We propose a novel Hollywood in Homes approach to collect such data. Instead of shooting videos in the lab, we ensure diversity by distributing and crowdsourcing the whole process of video creation from script writing to video recording and annotation. Following this procedure we collect a new dataset, Charades, with hundreds of people recording videos in their own homes, acting out casual everyday activities. The dataset is composed of 9,848 annotated videos with an average length of 30 seconds, showing activities of 267 people from three continents, and over 15% of the videos have more than one person. Each video is annotated by multiple free-text descriptions, action labels, action intervals and classes of interacted objects. In total, Charades provides 27,847 video descriptions, 66,500 temporally localized intervals for 157 action classes and 41,104 labels for 46 object classes. Using this rich data, we evaluate and provide baseline results for several tasks including action recognition and automatic description generation. We believe that the realism, diversity, and casual nature of this dataset will present unique challenges and new opportunities for computer vision community.",

Research suggests that it may be difficult to change vaccine-related attitudes, and there is currently no good evidence to recommend any particular intervention strategy. One reason for vaccine hesitancy is lack of trust that vaccine harms are adequately documented and reported, yet few communication strategies have explicitly attempted to improve this trust. This study tested the possibility that data from the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) can be used to increase trust that vaccine harms are adequately researched and that potential harms are disclosed to the public, and thereby improve perceptions of vaccines. In the study, participants were randomly assigned to one of three communication interventions. All participants read the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) vaccine information statement (VIS) for the HPV vaccine. Two other groups were exposed to additional information about VAERS, either summary data or full detailed reports of serious adverse events from 2013. Results showed that the CDC's VIS alone significantly increased perceptions of vaccine benefits and decreased perceived risks. Participants who were also educated about VAERS and given summary data about the serious adverse events displayed more trust in the CDC and greater HPV vaccine acceptance relative to the VIS alone. However, exposure to the detailed VAERS reports significantly reduced trust in the CDC and vaccine acceptance. Hence, general information about the VAERS data slightly increased trust in the CDC and improved vaccine acceptance, but the specific VAERS reports negatively influenced both trust and acceptance. Implications for communicating about vaccines are discussed.",

Yet public acceptance of water recycling often lags behind. It is unclear the degree to which individuals are aware of the role of disgust in their decisions about recycled water, how important anticipated disgust is to willingness to use when controlling for other factors, and what the most effective method of presenting information about water recycling would be to decrease disgust reactions and increase willingness to use. We used a two-pronged approach, combining a survey with open-ended and psychometric measures with an experimental manipulation, in a U.S., web-based sample (N = 428). Only 2% of participants self-identified disgust as important to their decisions about recycled water. When measured directly using a Likert scale, however, anticipated disgust was the strongest predictor of willingness to use recycled water when controlling for individual differences that have been shown to impact willingness to use, including a subscale of individual pathogen disgust sensitivity. Finally, participants were exposed to an educational brochure about water reuse framed either affectively or cognitively or were shown a simple, neutral definition. Exposure to either the affectively or cognitively framed brochures lowered anticipated disgust, but did not significantly affect willingness to use recycled water compared to the neutral condition.",

In this research, we combine disparate content and collaboration approaches through a social network analysis approach known as an affiliation network. It captures both how knowledge is transferred in a peer production network and also the underlying skills possessed by its contributors in a single methodological approach. We test this approach on the Wikipedia articles dedicated to medical information developed in a subcommunity known as a WikiProject. Overall, we find that the position of an article in the affiliation network is associated with the quality of the article. We further investigate information quality through additional qualitative and quantitative approaches including expert coders using medical students, crowdsourcing using Amazon Mechanical Turk, and visualization using network graphs. A review by fourth-year medical students indicates that the Wikipedia quality rating is a reliable measure of information quality. Amazon Mechanical Turk ratings, however, are a less reliable measure of information quality, reflecting observable content characteristics such as article length and the number of references.",

To examine these issues, we observed participants interacting in a four-round public goods game (PGG) with or without gossip and punishment options, and a subsequent two-round trust game (TG). We manipulated gossip as the option to send notes about other group members to these members’ future partners, and punishment as the option to assign deduction points to reduce other group members’ outcomes with a fee-to-fine ratio of 1:3. Findings revealed that in the four-round PGG, the option to gossip increased both cooperation and individual earnings, whereas the option to punish had no overall effect on cooperation (but a positive effect on cooperation in the last two rounds of the PGG) and significantly decreased individual earnings. Importantly, the initial option to gossip made people more trusting and trustworthy in the subsequent TG when gossip was no longer possible, compared to the no-gossip condition. Thus, we provide some initial evidence that gossip may be more effective and efficient than punishment to promote andmaintain cooperation.",

Participants were reminded of death (vs. control) and evaluated new, 20-, or 100-year-old objects. Results indicated death reminders resulted in greater valuation of older objects. Findings are discussed with implications for terror management theory, the longer-is-better effect, ageism, materialism, and consumer behaviour.",

Our focus is on the receiver side: what makes an individual feel loved and how felt love is defined through daily interactions. Our aim is to explore everyday life scenarios in which people might experience love, and to consider people’s converging and diverging judgments about which scenarios indicate felt love. We apply a cognitive psychometric approach to quantify a receiver’s ability to detect, understand, and know that they are loved. Through crowd-sourcing, we surveyed lay participants about whether various scenarios were indicators of felt love. We thus quantify these responses to make inference about consensus judgments of felt love, measure individual levels of agreement with consensus, and assess individual response styles. More specifically, we (1) derive consensus judgments on felt love; (2) describe its characteristics in qualitative and quantitative terms, (3) explore individual differences in both (a) participant agreement with consensus, and (b) participant judgment when uncertain about shared knowledge, and (4) test whether individual differences can be meaningfully linked to explanatory variables. Results indicate that people converge towards a shared cognitive model of felt love. Conversely, respondents showed heterogeneity in knowledge of consensus, and in dealing with uncertainty. We found that, when facing uncertainty, female respondents and people in relationships more frequently judge scenarios as indicators of felt love. Moreover, respondents from smaller households tend to know more about consensus judgments of felt love, while respondents from larger households are more willing to guess when unsure of consensus.",

It is less clear whether undiagnosed eating pathology and subsyndromal eating disorders carry the same risk and, if so, what mechanisms may explain why higher levels of eating pathology yield greater risk for engaging in suicidal behaviors. The indirect relationship between disordered eating and risk for suicidal behaviors via facets of experiential avoidance was tested using a multiple-mediator model. The model was tested using bootstrapping estimates of indirect effects in a sample of 218 noncollege student adults (Mage = 32.33, 66.1% women) with a history of suicidal attempt and/or history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Results revealed that disordered eating indirectly predicted risk for suicidal behaviors, distress aversion (i.e., negative attitudes or dislike of distress), and procrastination (i.e., delaying engagement with distressing activities). Results suggest that targeting experiential avoidance and helping those who have a history of engaging in suicidal behaviors and/or NSSI develop regulation strategies to use during times of distress may be of utmost importance for treatment and prevention of eating pathology.",

Political liberals and conservatives did not differ on intrapersonal or interpersonal moralities, which require self-regulation. However differences emerged on collective moralities, which involve social regulation. Contrary to Moral Foundations Theory, both liberals and conservatives endorsed a group-focused binding morality, specifically Social Justice and Social Order respectively. Libertarians were the group without a binding morality. Although Social Justice and Social Order appear conflictual, analyses based on earlier cross-cultural work on societal tightness-looseness suggest that countries actually benefit in terms of economic success and societal well-being when these group-based moralities co-exist and serve as counterweights in social regulation.",

If this theory holds, then it is likely that inter-individual variation in the same biases may predict corresponding variation in religious thoughts and behaviors. Using an online questionnaire, 298 participants answered questions regarding their tendency to detect agency, the degree to which they displayed schizotypal traits, their ability to understand the emotions and motivations of others (“mentalizing”), and their religious beliefs and behaviors. Path analysis suggests that mentalizing, agency detection, and schizotypal thinking were each independently related to religiosity. Furthermore, schizotypal thinking and agency detection were highly interrelated with one another, whereas mentalizing was not. Although the degree to which an individual engages with religious or spiritual beliefs will be influenced by their cultural and historical context, this paper helps to elucidate the interplay between various cognitive processes that might predispose some individuals but not others toward holding such beliefs in the first place.",

However, evidence that people show all three effects within the same paradigm has come from studies in which choices were averaged over participants. This averaging is only justified if those participants show qualitatively similar choice behaviors. To investigate whether this was the case, we repeated two experiments previously run by Trueblood (Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 19(5), 962-968, 2012) and Berkowitsch, Scheibehenne, and Rieskamp (Journal of Experimental Psychology, 143(3), 1331–1348, 2014). We found that individuals displayed qualitative differences in their choice behavior. In general, people did not simultaneously display all three context effects. Instead, we found a tendency for some people to show either the similarity effect or the compromise effect but not both. More importantly, many individuals showed strong dimensional biases that were much larger than any effects of context. This research highlights the dangers of averaging indiscriminately and the necessity for accounting for individual differences and dimensional biases in decision-making.",

Listeners consistently reported hearing more boundaries at syntactically licensed locations than at syntactically unlicensed locations, even when the acoustic evidence for an intonational boundary was controlled. This suggests that the processing of an intonational boundary is a product of both acoustic cues and listener expectations.",

Between commons-based peer-production and crowdsourced, user-generated content “enclosed” by corporations, a wide range of models combine different social, political, technical and economic arrangements. This combined analysis of the level of (de)centralisation of platform features provides information on emancipation capabilities in a more granular way than a market-based qualification of platforms, based on the nature of ownership or business models only. The five selected features of the proposed typology are: ownership of means of production, technical architecture/design, social organization/governance of work patterns, ownership of the peer-produced resource, and value of the output.",

Moreover, the basic needs component of Self-Determination Theory has also been proposed as an organizing framework to understand gaming motivation (33 and 47). Building on these ideas, the current study describes the development of a measure of contingent self-worth (9 and 10) specific to gaming experiences within Massively-Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs), and explores the association between Gaming-Contingent Self-Worth (GCSW) and symptoms of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). A sample of MMORPG players was recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (n = 600) to evaluate the reliability and validity of a GCSW scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify a 29-item measure comprised of four components, including validation seeking, reward orientation, competition focus, and detachment. Additional analyses supported the hypothesis that GCSW is a strong predictor of IGD symptoms, beyond the contribution of motivation based on behavioral activities within the game.",

Although they embed whquestions, they seem not to embed whether -questions. They have complex interactions with negative polarity items such as any or even, and they have been argued to preferentially give rise to weakly exhaustive readings with embedded questions (in contrasts with most other verbs, which have been argued to give rise to strongly exhaustive readings). We offer an empirical overview of the situation in three experiments collecting acceptability judgments, monotonicity judgments and truth-value judgments. The results first straightforwardly confirm the special selectional properties of emotive-factive predicates. More interestingly, the results reveal the existence of strongly exhaustive readings for surprise. The results also suggest that the special properties of emotivefactives cannot be solely explained by their monotonicity profiles, which was not found to differ from the profiles of other responsive predicates.",

Research has shown that these nonprobative photos increase false beliefs when combined with misleading suggestions and repeated exposure to the photo or target event. We propose that photos exert similar effects without those factors, and test that proposition in five experiments. In Experiment 1, people saw the names of several animals and pretended to give food to or take food from each. Then people saw the animal names again, half with a photo of the animal and half alone, and decided whether they had an experience with each. The photos led people to believe they had experiences with the animals. Moreover, Experiments 2–5 provided evidence that photos exerted these effects by making it easier to bring related thoughts and images to mind—a feeling that people mistook as evidence of genuine experience. In each experiment, photos led people to believe positive claims about the past (but not negative claims), consistent with evidence that feelings of ease selectively increase positive judgments. Experiment 4 also showed that photos (like other manipulations of ease) bias people’s judgments broadly, producing false beliefs about other people’s pasts. Finally, in Experiment 5, photos exerted more powerful effects when they depicted unfamiliar animals, and thus could most help bring information to mind. These findings suggest that nonprobative photos can distort the past without other factors that encourage false beliefs, and that they operate by helping related thoughts and images come to mind.",

While these benefits are relatively measurable, the value of privacy involved in disclosing the information is much less tangible, making it hard to design and evaluate information systems that manage personal information. Meanwhile, existing methods to assess and measure the value of privacy, such as self-reported questionnaires, are notoriously unrelated of real–world behavior. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a methodology called VOPE (Value of Privacy Estimator), which relies on behavioral economics' Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and valuates people's privacy preferences in information disclosure scenarios. VOPE is based on an iterative and responsive methodology in which users take or leave a transaction that includes a component of information disclosure. To evaluate the method, we conduct an empirical experiment (n = 195), estimating people's privacy valuations in electronic commerce transactions. We report on the convergence of estimations and validate our results by comparing the values to theoretical projections of existing results (Tsai, Egelman, Cranor, & Acquisti, 2011), and to another independent experiment that required participants to rank the sensitivity of information disclosure transactions. Finally, we discuss how information systems designers and regulators can use VOPE to create and to oversee systems that balance privacy and utility.",

In games where the player interacts with computer-controlled opponents, the difficulty of the game can be adjusted not only by changing the distribution of opponents or game resources, but also through modifying the skill of the opponents. Applying evolutionary algorithms to evolve the artificial intelligence that controls opponent agents is one established method for adjusting opponent difficulty. Less-evolved agents (i.e., agents subject to fewer generations of evolution) make for easier opponents, while highly-evolved agents are more challenging to overcome. In this publication we test a new approach for difficulty adjustment in games: orthogonally evolved AI, where the player receives support from collaborating agents that are co-evolved with opponent agents (where collaborators and opponents have orthogonal incentives). The advantage is that game difficulty can be adjusted more granularly by manipulating two independent axes: by having more or less adept collaborators, and by having more or less adept opponents. Furthermore, human interaction can modulate (and be informed by) the performance and behavior of collaborating agents. In this way, orthogonally evolved AI both facilitates smoother difficulty adjustment and enables new game experiences.",

However, social and emotional cognition can be subdivided into a number of distinct dimensions, and some work suggests that analytic thinking is in tension with some aspects of social-emotional cognition. This leaves open two questions. First, is belief linked to social and emotional cognition in general, or a specific dimension in particular? Second, does the negative relationship between belief and analytic thinking still hold after relationships with social and emotional cognition are taken into account? We report eight hypothesis-driven studies which examine these questions. These studies are guided by a theoretical model which focuses on the distinct social and emotional processing deficits associated with autism spectrum disorders (mentalizing) and psychopathy (moral concern). To our knowledge no other study has investigated both of these dimensions of social and emotion cognition alongside analytic thinking. We find that religious belief is robustly positively associated with moral concern (4 measures), and that at least part of the negative association between belief and analytic thinking (2 measures) can be explained by a negative correlation between moral concern and analytic thinking. Using nine different measures of mentalizing, we found no evidence of a relationship between mentalizing and religious or spiritual belief. These findings challenge the theoretical view that religious and spiritual beliefs are linked to the perception of agency, and suggest that gender differences in religious belief can be explained by differences in moral concern. These findings are consistent with the opposing domains hypothesis, according to which brain areas associated with moral concern and analytic thinking are in tension.",

In the present study, using a sample of American adults (n = 412), the role of political orientation (conservative vs. liberal) and basic knowledge about fracking on fracking risk perception attitudes, fracking economic attitudes, energy reliance attitudes, trust of energy information sources, and preferred dwelling distance from energy operations was investigated. Basic knowledge about hydraulic fracturing as a possible moderating mechanism was also explored. Correlational and regression results revealed that political ideology and basic fracking knowledge are key predictors of fracking and energy source attitudes, and that the nature of the relation between ideology and fracking risk perceptions, fracking economic attitudes, reliance on natural gas, wind and solar, and distrust of government agencies, are influenced by an individual’s basic knowledge about fracking.",

Yet, it remains insufficiently understood why, how, and by whom unequal systems tend to be perpetuated. In two studies we examine whether psychological mindsets adopted by the wealthy and the poor in their micro-social transactions act to perpetuate or challenge inequality. We hypothesized that occupying a wealthier socioeconomic position promotes the pursuit of self-interest and contributes to inequality maintenance; poorer socioeconomic position, on the other hand, should promote the pursuit of fairness and equality restoration. In Study 1, participants completed an ultimatum game as proposers after being primed to believe they are wealthier or poorer, offering money to either poor or wealthy responders. As expected, the wealthy pursued their self-interest and the net effect of this behavior contributes to the maintenance of inequality. Conversely, the poor pursued fairness and the net effect of this behavior challenges inequality. In Study 2, participants were responders deciding whether to accept or reject unfair distributions. Compared to the wealthier, the poorer challenged inequality by rejecting unequal offers. The links between micro-social processes and macro-societal inequality are discussed.",

It is important to understand these racks’ fuel consumption impacts on both individual vehicles and the national fleet because they are widely used. We estimate the national fuel consumption impacts of roof racks using a bottom-up approach. Our model incorporates real-world data and vehicle stock information to enable assessing fuel consumption impacts for several categories of vehicles, rack configurations, and usage conditions. In addition, the model draws on two new data-gathering techniques, on-line forums and crowd-sourcing. The results show that nationwide, roof racks are responsible for 0.8‰ of light duty vehicle fuel consumption in 2015, corresponding to 100 million gallons of gasoline per year. Sensitivity analyses show that results are most sensitive to the fraction of vehicles with installed roof racks but carrying no equipment. The aerodynamic efficiency of typical roof racks can be greatly improved and reduce individual vehicle fuel consumption; however, government policies to minimize extensive driving with empty racks—if successful—could save more fuel nationally.",

It is hypothesized that the Whiter one appears, the more the suspect will be protected from police force. Internal use of force case files from a large police department were coded for severity of police force, and suspects’ booking photographs were scored for phenotypic racial stereotypicality. Regression analyses confirmed that police used less force with highly stereotypical Whites, and this protective effect was stronger than the effect for non-Whites. Results suggest that intragroup bias is a protective factor for Whites, but not for non-Whites, providing an additional route through which racial disparities in policing operate.",

We propose that charismatic leadership and followership can be best understood as a product of this recurrent, fitness-relevant selection pressure for adaptations that effectively promoted and sustained prosocial behaviors within groups. We describe charismatic leadership and followership as a dynamic process in which leaders signal their ability to benefit the group by increasing the perceived likelihood that cooperation will succeed. A charismatic leader is one who is able to attract the attention of other group members and serve as a focal point for aligning and synchronizing prosocial orientations in followers, suppressing sensitivity to cooperative risks, and enhancing the salience of perceived cooperative rewards. We hypothesize that exposure to such individuals will activate heuristics causing participants to behave more prosocially. The results of three economic experiments (N = 500) provide behavioral evidence for the “charismatic prosociality” hypothesis through the use of the Trust, Dictator, and Stag Hunt Games.",

For example, Western cultures typically prioritize values like autonomy and freedom, whereas East-Asian cultures put more emphasis on harmony and community. We present an alternative approach for investigating such cultural differences based on thesaurus databases that reflect the use of value terms in everyday language. We present a methodology that integrates empirical value research with linguistics and novel computer visualization tools to map and visualize value spaces. The maps outline variations in the semantic neighborhood of value terms. Based on 460 value terms both for US-English and German, we created for each language a map of 78 value classes that were further validated in two surveys. The use of such maps could inform research in three ways: first, by allowing for a controlled variability in the usage of value terms when generating vignettes; second, by indicating potential difficulties when translating value terms that display considerable differences in their semantic neighborhood; and third, as heuristics for better understanding value plurality.",

These arguments are compelling enough to motivate the design of a novel fractional-order control scheme that enforces finite-time convergence of the sliding manifold to guarantee local exponential tracking. The controller does not exhibit chattering and does not require the knowledge of the dynamic model. The stability analysis is based on a proposed resetting memory principle to deal with memory effects of the differintegral operator, which allows the controller to tackle also robustness against continuous disturbances that are not necessarily differentiable in the conventional sense such as some aerodynamic phenomena. Experimental evidence is presented and discussed to expose the enforcement of the sliding manifold based on a fractional-order reaching phase that demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.",

Respondents interact with and rely on the sources moderately. Credibility ratings range from moderate to highly credible. Reliance predicts credibility of 14 of 15 sources as compared to interactivity that predicts credibility of just 9 of 15 sources.

Yet the sequential voting mechanisms that are commonly used by these systems are at odds with existing theoretical and empirical literature on optimal aggregation. This literature suggests that sequential voting will promote herding—the tendency for individuals to copy the decisions of others around them—and hence lead to suboptimal content recommendation. Is there a problem with our practice, or a problem with our theory? Previous attempts at answering this question have been limited by a lack of objective measurements of content quality. Quality is typically defined endogenously as the popularity of content in absence of social influence. The flaw of this metric is its presupposition that the preferences of the crowd are aligned with underlying quality. Domains in which content quality can be defined exogenously and measured objectively are thus needed in order to better assess the design choices of social recommendation systems. In this work, we look to the domain of education, where content quality can be measured via how well students are able to learn from the material presented to them. Through a behavioral experiment involving a simulated massive open online course (MOOC) run on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that sequential voting systems can surface better content than systems that elicit independent votes.",

Accordingly, this study explored whether first-time expectant parents’ beliefs about gendered family roles and the importance of fathers to child development were related to their TV use. Participants were 201 individuals (122 women, 79 men) from across the United States expecting their first biological child in a cohabiting heterosexual relationship. Participants completed an online survey assessing weekly TV exposure, exposure to TV programs featuring fathers, perceived realism of TV, use of TV to learn about the world, and beliefs about both fathers’ importance to child development and family gender roles. Zero-order correlations indicated that increased exposure to TV in general and to programs featuring fathers, perceived realism, and stronger learning motives were each linked to less egalitarian gender role beliefs in both women and men. Among women, heavier exposure to TV in general and to programs featuring fathers, and stronger learning motives were each correlated with weaker beliefs that fathers were important to child development. Multiple regression analyses, however, indicated that attributing more realism to TV content uniquely predicted more traditional gendered family role beliefs and beliefs that fathers are less important to child development across the whole sample. Even among men with low perceived realism, greater exposure to TV fathers was linked with weaker beliefs that fathers were important to child development. First-time expectant fathers may be especially vulnerable to media messages about father roles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Rather than functioning as a moderator of party identification, perhaps anxiety has a direct effect on preferences, or perhaps the relationship is reversed and preferences drive emotions (Ladd and Lenz 2008). Alternatively, Marcus et al.’s measure of anxiety may simply be capturing partisan ambivalence, so the posited relationship is spurious (Lavine, Johnston, and Steenbergen 2012). This paper addresses each of these questions by examining the effect of experimentally induced emotions on the types of considerations that came to mind when a national sample of adult Americans was asked what they liked and disliked about Barack Obama. By directly manipulating anxiety, this experiment avoids the causal ambiguity plaguing this debate and ascertains the true nature of the relationship between anxiety and ambivalence. Consistent with AIT, anxiety led respondents to recall more contemporary considerations, whereas enthusiasm brought to mind more long-standing considerations. Because the political context at the time of the study (fall2013) was a very tumultuous time for the Obama administration, the increased accessibility of contemporary considerations led Democratic participants to experience more ambivalence in the anxiety condition. This effect was concentrated among those Democrats who were exposed to the most newspaper coverage.",

Of those who denied the possibility of experiencing depression, approximately 70% met traditional criteria for the disorder. In addition, a significant number of men endorsed a unique profile of symptoms not captured by traditional notions of depression (e.g., feeling that one needs to handle problems on one’s own and feeling under constant pressure).

These incidents can have a devastating impact on business if consumers do not return to the mall after the incident (Morris and Stevens 2014). While managing consumer perceptions of the shopping mall is very important, little research has been conducted on post-incident consumer behavior at shopping malls. The purpose of this exploratory research was to investigate consumers’ emotional, attitudinal, and behavioral responses to acts of gun violence at shopping malls. The research is grounded by the stimulus-organism-response framework (Mehrabian and Russell 1974) as well as the attitude-behavior connection (Ajzen and Fishbein 1977). Data were collected via an online questionnaire. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was utilized to recruit participants to complete the questionnaire. A total of 244 usable questionnaires were completed by U.S. consumers. The questionnaire contained four sections. Participants were first asked to respond to Likert-type scale items to assess their current intentions to visit their favorite shopping mall (Stoehl et al. 2004). In the second section of the questionnaire, participants read a fictional newspaper article about a shooting that recently occurred at their favorite shopping mall. The newspaper account was based on a collection of actual newspaper articles about recent mall shooting incidents. In the fictional newspaper article, the act of gun violence was described as being a random event in which one customer was killed by a gunman who later killed himself. After participants read the fictional newspaper article, they completed a semantic differential scale designed to assess their feelings of pleasure and arousal associated with visiting their favorite shopping mall following the shooting incident (Donovan et al. 1994). Next, participants were directed to respond to Likert-type scale items designed to assess their attitudes toward the mall following the shooting incident (Yoo and MacInnis 1998). Participants then responded to the same items from the first section of the questionnaire again to assess their post-incident intentions to visit the mall. Demographic information was collected in the fourth and final section of the questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. The structural model exhibited a moderate, but acceptable, fit. Participants’ intention to visit the shopping mall following an act of gun violence was predicted by their attitudes toward the shopping mall. Although level of pleasure and level of arousal were both hypothesized to be emotional antecedents of consumers’ post-incident attitudes toward the shopping mall, only level of pleasure was significantly related to attitudes in the model. Hence, mall managers should perhaps try to emphasize the pleasurable aspects of the shopping mall to encourage consumers to re-patronize the mall following a shooting episode.",

It was believed that personality factors (dependency and self-criticism) and culture would impact the perception of resilience in individuals. A community sample of 210 participants representing both India and the United States were recruited through Mechanical Turk. Results revealed that dependency was related to greater perceived resilience in the India group and to less perceived resilience in the US group. Perceived resilience was related to self-criticism in the US group, but was not related in the India group. Social support was strongly related to perceived resilience in both cultures. These results suggest that perceived resilience and social support may depend on personality and cultural factors.",

Theoretical accounts of semantic knowledge posit that relations between concepts provide organizational structure that converts information known about individual entities into an interconnected network in which concepts can be linked by many types of relations (e.g., taxonomic, thematic). The goal of the current research was to address several methodological shortcomings of prior studies on the development of semantic organization, by using a variant of the spatial arrangement method (SpAM) to collect graded judgments of relatedness for a set of entities that can be cross-classified into either taxonomic or thematic groups. In Experiment 1, we used the cross-classify SpAM (CC–SpAM) to obtain graded relatedness judgments and derive a representation of developmental changes in the organization of semantic knowledge. In Experiment 2, we validated the findings of Experiment 1 by using a more traditional pairwise similarity judgment paradigm. Across both experiments, we found that an early recognition of links between entities that are both taxonomically and thematically related preceded an increasing recognition of links based on a single type of relation. The utility of CC–SpAM for evaluating theoretical accounts of semantic development is discussed.",

These processes – part of what has been referred to as the behavioural immune system – are, in a way, our ‘evolved’ health psychology. However, scholars have scarcely investigated how the behavioural immune system relates to health-protective behaviours. The current research attempts to fill this gap Design: Across two cross-sectional studies (N = 386 and 470, respectively), we examined the relationship between pathogen-avoidance motives and health-protective behaviour. Outcome Measures: The studies used self-reported measures of attitude and intention as indicators of health-protective behaviour. Results: Data collected in Study 1 revealed that pathogen-avoidance motivation related to participants’ attitude and intention towards sexually transmitted infections screening. High levels of pathogen-avoidance motivation were also related to having had fewer sexual partners, which partially mediated the effect of pathogen-avoidance variables on testing motivation. Study 2 extended these findings by showing moderate associations between pathogen-avoidance motivation and a broad range of health-protective behaviours, including but not limited to pathogen-related health concerns.Conclusion: We argue that understanding and targeting pathogen-avoidance psychology can add novel and important understanding of health-protective behaviour.",

However, livestock industries claim they are deceptive. One strategy to curtail these investigations has been the introduction of so-called ag-gag legislation, which aims to restrict the flow of information coming out of farm facilities. Psychological research suggests that this approach may be counter-productive as reducing information flow often reduces feelings of trust. We sought to extend these findings by applying them to a real-world, timely example and to determine whether the perceived intention to obstruct access to information erodes feelings of trust. Accordingly, this study tested whether simply being made aware of ag-gag laws might have a negative impact on trust in farmers. Participants (n = 716) were randomly assigned to either receive information about ag-gag laws or to a Control condition. We found that most people were unaware of ag-gag laws and that learning about them lead to a decrease in trust in farmers and an increase in support for animal welfare regulations. Interestingly, we also found evidence that awareness of ag-gag laws negatively impacted perceptions of the current status of farm animal welfare as well as the perception that farmers do a good job of protecting the environment. Through this topical example, this study demonstrates that even the intention to restrict access to information can undermine trust.",

The current investigation considered how shame and depression may help to explain the relationship between social anxiety and interpersonal suicide risk factors. Participants (N=259), recruited using Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk, completed measures of social anxiety, interpersonal suicide risk factors, shame, and depression. Social anxiety was associated with greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. In addition, shame partially explained the association between social anxiety and thwarted belongingness, though the indirect effect was no longer significant after considering depression as a moderator. As predicted, shame was found to fully explain the association between social anxiety and perceived burdensomeness and this indirect effect was most pronounced among individuals with high comorbid depression. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",

The current study aimed to extend this research by testing a model examining associations between general psychological flexibility, psychological flexibility specific to the parenting role, adaptive parenting practices, and child internalizing and externalizing problems across three developmental stages. Participants (N=615; 55% female) were parents of children in young childhood (3–7 years; n=210), middle childhood (8–12 years; n=200), and adolescence (13–17 years;n=205). Parents reported on their general psychological flexibility, parenting-specific psychological flexibility, parenting practices, and their child's or adolescent's internalizing and/or externalizing problems. Findings were consistent across child age groups and demonstrated that higher levels of parenting-specific psychological flexibility were indirectly related to lower levels of youth internalizing and externalizing problems through adaptive parenting practices. Implications for promotion of well-being within the family context among normative samples are discussed.",

Web-based education tools have been proven effective in many domains and have been increasingly adopted by many online professional and educational services. However, the design and development of Web-based education tools for online privacy is still in the early stage. The traditional solutions always involve privacy experts who have sophisticated expertise. Such involvement can make the tool development costly. Furthermore, it is not clear how inspiring and effective these education tools are to general users of varying backgrounds, specially to novice users who have rarely dealt with online privacy issues before.

Exposure to traumatic events alone, however, is insufficient to determine if an individual has PTSD. PTSD is a heterogeneous diagnosis such that assessment of all 20 symptoms is problematic in time-limited treatment settings. Brief assessment tools that identify those at risk for PTSD and measure symptom severity are needed to improve access to care and assess treatment response. The present study evaluated abbreviated measures of PTSD symptoms derived from the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) – a 20-item validated measure of PTSD symptoms – across two studies. In the first, using a community sample of adults exposed to a traumatic event, 4-and 8-item versions of the PCL-5 were identified that were highly correlated with the full PCL-5. In the second, using a sample of combat veterans, the 4-and 8-item measures had comparable diagnostic utility to the total-scale PCL-5. These results provide support for an abbreviated measure of the PCL-5 as an alternative to the 20-item total scale.",

Neither political scientists nor psychologists have been able to firmly establish why this behavior occurs. Previous research has explored, at length, social influence on political attitudes and persuasion. However, the concept of conformity does not involve attitude change or persuasion; it more accurately involves self-censoring to match a socially desirable norm. In an effort to improve our understanding of this behavior, we conduct two experiments to investigate perceptions and behavioral responses to contentious political interactions. Study 1 asked participants to predict how a hypothetical character would respond to a variety of political interactions among coworkers. In Study 2, participants discussed political issues with confederates who were scripted to disagree with them. The studies reveal that individuals are uncomfortable around political interactions in which they hold an opinion counter to the group. Participants both expected a hypothetical character to conform in Study 1 and actually conformed themselves in the lab session in Study 2.",

Despite the fruitful research on the impact of such programs on customers’ purchasing behavior and loyalty, there is limited research on factors influencing customers’ likelihood to join a program in the casino industry. To bridge the gap, the present research aims to examine the combined effect of number of tiers and gender on customers’ attitudes and intention to join a loyalty rewards program. The results indicate that male customers exhibited more positive attitudes and higher level of intention to join a program that has four tiers (vs. two tiers). Conversely, female customers’ attitudes and joining intentions are stronger when facing a loyalty rewards program containing two tiers (vs. four tiers). The underlying psychological mechanism is individuals’ need for status (NFS).",

This question has particular relevance for treatment incorporating visual biofeedback, where clinician cueing can direct the learner's attention either internally (i.e., to the movements of the articulators) or externally (i.e., to the visual biofeedback display). Aims This study addressed two objectives. First, it aimed to use single-subject experimental methods to collect additional evidence regarding the efficacy of visual–acoustic biofeedback treatment for children with /r/ misarticulation. Second, it compared the efficacy of this biofeedback intervention under two cueing conditions. In the external focus (EF) condition, participants’ attention was directed exclusively to the external biofeedback display. In the internal focus (IF) condition, participants viewed a biofeedback display, but they also received articulatory cues encouraging an internal direction of attentional focus. Methods & Procedures Nine school-aged children were pseudo-randomly assigned to receive either IF or EF cues during 8 weeks of visual–acoustic biofeedback intervention. Accuracy in /r/ production at the word level was probed in three to five pre-treatment baseline sessions and in three post-treatment maintenance sessions. Outcomes were assessed using visual inspection and calculation of effect sizes for individual treatment trajectories. In addition, a mixed logistic model was used to examine across-subjects effects including phase (pre/post-treatment), /r/ variant (treated/untreated), and focus cue condition (internal/external). Outcomes & Results Six out of nine participants showed sustained improvement on at least one treated /r/ variant; these six participants were evenly divided across EF and IF treatment groups. Regression results indicated that /r/ productions were significantly more likely to be rated accurate post- than pre-treatment. Internal versus external direction of focus cues was not a significant predictor of accuracy, nor did it interact significantly with other predictors. Conclusions The results are consistent with previous literature reporting that visual–acoustic biofeedback can produce measurable treatment gains in children who have not responded to previous intervention. These findings are also in keeping with previous research suggesting that biofeedback may be sufficient to establish an external attentional focus, independent of verbal cues provided. The finding that explicit articulator placement cues were not necessary for progress in treatment has implications for intervention practices for speech-sound disorders in children.",

The current study investigated how parenting style relates to twelve parental feeding practices. DESIGN: Data on parenting style and parental feeding practices were obtained for a correlational study from users of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, an online survey system. SETTING:USA. SUBJECTS: Mothers of children aged 7-11 years (n 193). RESULTS: Parenting style related differentially to eleven out of the twelve measured practices. Authoritative mothers displayed more feeding practices that promote child health and fewer practices that impede child health. Authoritarian and permissive mothers displayed more unhealthy practices than authoritative mothers, but differed from each other on the practices they employed. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting style may relate to more aspects of feeding than previously realized. The inclusion of numerous healthy feeding practices along with unhealthy practices in the current study provides suggestions for the application of healthy feeding behaviours. Instruction on feeding behaviours and parenting style should be a focus of future educational programmes.",

Methods We ascertained attitudes toward genetic testing and genetic research by race in the United States using the online Amazon mTurk US workforce (n = 403 White; n = 56 African American (AA)). Generalized linear models were used to test differences in beliefs and preferences by race, adjusting for sociodemographics and prior genetic experience. Results AA were less likely than White to believe that genetic tests should be promoted or made available. Further, AA were less likely to want genetic testing results or to participate in genetic research. Conclusions Important dimensions that underlay PM are not universally accepted by all populations.

Then, we categorize them as being news or as being conversational messages, and assessed their credibility. From the gained insights we used features to automatically assess whether a post is news or chat, and to level its credibility. Based on these two experiments we built an automatic classifier. The results from assessing our classifier, which categorizes posts as being relevant or not, lead to a high balanced accuracy, with the potential to be further enhanced.",

Bush and Senator John McCain, respectively. Some interpreted these results as reflecting “conservative shift” following exposure to threat, whereas others emphasized preferences for “charismatic” leadership following exposure to death primes. To assess both hypotheses in the context of a new election cycle featuring a liberal incumbent who was considered to be charismatic, we conducted four experiments shortly before the 2012 election involving President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney. Contrary to earlier studies, there was little evidence that mortality salience, either by itself or in interaction with political orientation, affected overall candidate ratings or voting intentions. However, a significant interaction between mortality salience and system justification in some studies indicated a more circumscribed effect. The failure to “replicate” previous results in the context of this election may be attributable to disagreement among participants as to which of the candidates better represented the societal status quo.",

Against this assumption, we argue that the difference is merely a quantitative one: ‘x is a y’ unilaterally entails ‘x is like a y’, and therefore the latter is merely weaker than the former. Moreover, if ‘x is like a y’ licenses the inference thatx is not a y, then that inference is a scalar implicature. We defend these claims partly on theoretical grounds and partly on the basis of experimental evidence. A suite of experiments indicates both that ‘x is a y’ unilaterally entails that x is like a y, and that in several respects the non-y inference behaves exactly as one should expect from a scalar implicature. We discuss the implications of our view of categorisation and comparison statements for categorisation models of metaphor interpretation.",

In addition to collecting diverse data, the d/SLHC was designed to benefit participants by enabling reflection on their sexual and relationship experiences in the context of other life events and circumstances. In a pilot study of the d/SLHC, survey data were collected to test whether creating a d/SLHC timeline had any impact on sexual well-being. A sample of 18- to 25-year-old participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) completed an online survey about sexuality and relationships. Of those, 113 also completed d/SLHC timelines and 262 served as a comparison group. Six months later, participants from both groups were invited to complete a follow-up survey (total N = 249). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that participants who completed d/SLHC timelines exhibited higher sexual esteem immediately following d/SLHC completion and at follow-up. No changes in sexual esteem were observed in the comparison group, and there were no differences between the groups with regard to sexual health behaviors and outcomes. These findings suggest that sexuality studies may have the potential to yield not only rich data for researchers but also rich experiences for participants.",

Such contextual information activates a set of medial lobe brain regions, the parahippocampal cortex and the retrosplenial complex. Both regions are more activated by single objects with a unique contextual association than by objects not associated with any specific context. Similarly they are more activated by spatially coherent arrangements of objects when those are consistent with their known spatial relations. The current study tested how context in multiple-object displays is represented in these regions in the absence of relevant spatial information. Using an fMRI slow-event-related design, we show that the precuneus (a subpart of the retrosplenial complex) is more activated by simultaneously presented contextually related objects than by unrelated objects. This suggests that the representation of context in this region is cumulative, representing integrated information across objects in the display. We discuss these findings in relation to processing of visual information and relate them to previous findings of contextual effects in perception.",

Particularly, we investigate two tasks: 1) given a query image, we retrieve textual descriptions that correspond to the visual attributes in the query; and 2) given a textual query that may express an interest in specific visual product characteristics, we retrieve relevant images that exhibit the required visual attributes. To this end, we introduce a new dataset that consists of 53,689 images coupled with textual descriptions. The images contain fashion garments that display a great variety of visual attributes, such as different shapes, colors and textures in natural language. Unlike previous datasets, the text provides a rough and noisy description of the item in the image. We extensively analyze this dataset in the context of cross-modal e-commerce search.

This explanatory aim was the goal of a national quota online sample of Americans (n = 815) who reported their beliefs and attitudes about Ebola in early December, three weeks after the second US death. Responses were shaped particularly by risk judgments and concern, but also by available Ebola information (from news attention or residence in a state with Ebola experience), political cues (partisanship, ideology), and demographics. Judgments of personal risk and US/global risk were shaped by largely different factors; for example, knowledge of Ebola exposure routes exhibited negative and positive signs, respectively.

In the present research, we tested the conditions under which this may (not) occur, including the perceived opportunity to blend on-site and off-site working through the effective use of computers and modern information and communication technology. Our sample consisted of 657 workers (51% female) representing a variety of industries. As hypothesized, it is not high job demands per se, but high demands in combination with a high need for autonomy and a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working that undermines intrinsic work motivation. When workers high in need for autonomy perceived opportunities for blended working, their intrinsic work motivation was not negatively affected by increasing job demands. This main finding suggests that, particularly for workers high in need for autonomy, the perceived opportunity for blended working is an effective, contemporary resource to cope with the increasing job demands typically observed in today's workplace. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the refinement and extension of influential demands-resource models and Person-Job Fit theory. Practically, our findings may show managers how to effectively keep workers intrinsically motivated and productive in their jobs when job demands are high.",

Using a sample of 571 college students, the Criteria for Marriage Readiness Scale (CMRS) was assessed to see if results from a previous validation study could be replicated. Results largely replicated previous findings but suggested a shorter and slightly revised version of the CMRS. A sample of 102 individuals with no college experience were then also administered the CMRS to see if measurement remained valid across a noncollege population. Results suggested that the CMRS may not be a valid measurement in this population, and further tests revealed that the college and noncollege samples were not invariant in regards to the factor structure of the CMRS. Implications for the assessment of marital beliefs given the lack of research on noncollege samples is discussed.",

The current study aimed to differentiate between causal effects of experiencing versus internalizing weight bias on emotional responses and psychological well-being. Adults with overweight/obesity (N = 260) completed an online experiment in which they were randomly assigned to focus on either the experience or internalization of weight bias, and completed measures of affect, self-esteem, and body dissatisfaction. Results indicated that the Internalization condition led to more negative affect, less positive affect, and lower self-esteem than the Experience condition. The Internalization condition also led to heightened body dissatisfaction among men, but not women. These findings suggest that weight bias internalization may be a stronger predictor of poor mental and physical health than experiences alone, and carry implications for developing weight bias interventions.",

In three cross-sectional studies (N = 1,403), we examined how the Dark Triad traits were correlated with measures of resource availability, harshness, and unpredictability in one’s childhood and adulthood. The Dark Triad traits were correlated with self-reports of an unpredictable childhood when using both the Short Dark Triad and the Dirty Dozen measures. These effects were somewhat stronger in men than in women and were replicable across samples. We also replicated sex differences in the Dark Triad traits but found none for our measures of socioecological conditions. Results are discussed in terms of the recurrent unpredictability in evolutionary history necessitating the sensitivity and responsiveness to such features to enable survival and reproduction. We contend that the Dark Triad traits might be condition-sensitive adaptations to socioecological unpredictability that all people could have if properly motivated.",

(2011) found that individual analytical style (reflective vs. intuitive) predicts belief in God or a higher power. Although intuitive thinkers are more likely to have strengthened religious beliefs since childhood, there is no correlation between analytical style and familial religiosity during childhood. This study examines the hypothesis that the link between intuitive thinking and religious belief is part of a broader preference for teleological explanations. We also test a possible mechanism responsible for teleological endorsement: intuitive thinkers may endorse teleological explanations because they confuse causal directionality. Methods Used A questionnaire comprised of a randomized series of stimuli was administered via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Stimuli included the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005) to determine analytical style, questions on conditional probability to judge causal reasoning (Kahneman & Tversky, 1977), and a series of true or false questions on various teleological statements (Kelemen et al., 2013). Participants were then asked to rank on a scale from 1–7 the extent to which they believe in the existence of God or a higher power, and the extent to which they believe such a higher power influences events in the world (agency). Statistical analysis was performed using Spearman correlation. Summary of Results As expected, teleological endorsement levels positively predicted belief in agency of a higher power (R=0.28, p<.01) and CRT score negatively predicted teleological endorsement levels (R=−0.24, p<.01). However, no significant correlation was found between CRT performance and tendencies in responding to conditional probability stimuli (R=0.017, p=0.85). Individual belief in agency of a higher power predicts teleological tendencies to a greater extent than religious belief alone (p=0.075) for belief in higher power, compared with p=0.085 for belief in agency of higher power. Conclusions Our results replicate previous findings that show a relationship between intuitive thinking and religious beliefs and suggest that this may reflect a general preference for teleological explanations. However, the reasons why intuitive thinkers endorse teleological explanations are still unclear.",

Errors can occur in the textual content of the data in the fields of the XML. Fixing these errors manually is time-consuming and expensive, especially for large amounts of data. There is increasing interest in the research, development, and use of automated techniques for assisting with data cleaning. Electronic dictionaries are an important form of data frequently stored in XML format that frequently have errors introduced through a mixture of manual typographical entry errors and optical character recognition errors. In this paper we describe methods for flagging statistical anomalies as likely errors in electronic dictionaries stored in XML format. We describe six systems based on different sources of information. The systems detect errors using various signals in the data including uncommon characters, text length, character-based language models, wordbased language models, tied-field length ratios, and tied-field transliteration models. Four of the systems detect errors based on expectations automatically inferred from content within elements of a single field type. We call these single-field systems. Two of the systems detect errors based on correspondence expectations automatically inferred from content within elements of multiple related field types. We call these tied-field systems. For each system, we provide an intuitive analysis of the type of error that it is successful at detecting. Finally, we describe two largerscale evaluations using crowdsourcing with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform and using the annotations of a domain expert. The evaluations consistently show that the systems are useful for improving the efficiency with which errors in XML electronic dictionaries can be detected.",

Participants (N = 150) categorized faces as trustworthy or untrustworthy in Study 1. Participants (N = 151) categorized faces as displaying Duchenne or non-Duchenne smiles in Study 2. Participants in both studies then completed measures of psychopathy, emotional intelligence, and social intelligence. In Study 1, higher levels of secondary psychopathy were associated with reduced trustworthiness detection for individuals lower in emotional intelligence. Both primary and secondary psychopathy were associated with reduced trustworthiness detection for individuals lower in social intelligence. In Study 2, higher levels of primary psychopathy were associated with reduced accuracy at discriminating Duchenne from non-Duchenne smiles for individuals lower in emotional and social intelligence. Independent of social and emotional intelligence, higher levels of secondary psychopathy were associated with reduced accuracy in discriminating trustworthy from untrustworthy faces and Duchenne from non-Duchenne smiles; primary psychopathy was unrelated to trustworthiness and smile discrimination accuracy. These studies suggest that the relationship between psychopathy and accurate identification of trustworthiness and affiliation cues in faces is influenced by the dimension of psychopathy and levels of emotional and social intelligence, respectively. Implications of these findings are discussed.",

This study evaluated how weight-status and its perception related to parents’ personal and parenting attitudes/behaviors. Design and Methods Participants were parents (N = 1,007; 65.3% mothers, 34.4% fathers) of children 5 to 15 years old. Parents completed online measures of personal eating attitudes/behaviors, attitudes/behaviors about their children's eating and weight, and parental practices related to weight-related attitudes. Results Parents frequently underestimated children's overweight/obesity, even more frequently than their own overweight/obesity (P < 0.001). Parents’ personal eating attitudes/behaviors were related to their own weight-status (P < 0.001) and perceived child weight-status (P < 0.001) but not actual child weight-status. Parents’ child-focused eating attitudes/behaviors were related to actual (P < 0.001) and perceived child weight-status (P < 0.001), but not parent weight-status. Conclusions In general, parents’ personal attitudes/behaviors did not extend into their perceptions of their children's weight or their response to it. Results suggest a dual need to improve parent accuracy perceiving children's overweight/obesity and to guide parent responses to perceived overweight/obesity. Given the high prevalence of childhood obesity, and the serious consequences during childhood and into adulthood, further research is needed to enhance understanding of parents’ specific needs to engage in prevention and treatment programs.",

However, fitting the parameters of these models can be challenging: the parameters are not identifiable, estimates are unreliable, and the fitted models may not have good predictive validity. Prior distributions on the parameters can help regularize estimates and to some extent deal with these challenges, but picking a good prior is itself challenging. This paper presents empirical priors for reinforcement learning models, showing that priors estimated from a relatively large dataset are more identifiable, more reliable, and have better predictive validity compared to model-fitting with uniform priors.",

Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked “What vehicle is the person riding?”, computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) in order to answer correctly that “the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.” In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifi- cally, our dataset contains over 100K images where each image has an average of 21 objects, 18 attributes, and 18 pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answers.",

We manipulated facial redness by slightly increasing or decreasing the redness on the faces of baseline pictures of target women, and then had men judge the attractiveness of the women. We also examined healthiness perceptions as a mediator of the redness-attraction relation, along with several other candidate mediator variables. A series of experiments showed that increased redness led to increased ratings of attractiveness, and decreased redness led to decreased ratings of attractiveness. Perceived healthiness was documented as a mediator of the influence of female facial redness on male perceptions of attractiveness, and this mediation was independent of other candidate mediator variables. The findings highlight the importance of attending to facial coloration as an attraction-relevant cue and point to interesting areas for subsequent research.",

This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-off between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-off is spaced repetition, which uses periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though spaced repetition is widely used in practice, e.g., in electronic flashcard software, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we mine log data from spaced repetition software to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, we use this memory model to develop a stochastic model for spaced repetition systems. We propose a queueing network model of the Leitner system for reviewing flashcards, along with a heuristic approximation that admits a tractable optimization problem for review scheduling. Finally, we empirically evaluate our queueing model through a Mechanical Turk experiment, verifying a key qualitative prediction of our model: the existence of a sharp phase transition in learning outcomes upon increasing the rate of new item introductions.",

We therefore examined whether mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ]) partially mediated the relationship between self-reported trauma exposure, whether occurring during childhood or anytime in life, and outcomes of PTSD, dissociative subtype PTSD, and TRASC in 952 trauma-exposed participants surveyed online. The relationships between increased traumatic experiences and PTSD, dissociative PTSD, and TRASC were partially mediated by the decreased capacity for mindful describing, acting with awareness, and non-judging traits, although decreased mindful non-reactivity partially mediated only the association between increased childhood trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms, while increased mindful observing partially mediated the association between increased lifetime trauma exposure and increased PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Our findings suggest that altered or decreased capacity for different facets of trait mindfulness may be one mechanism by which trauma exposure leads to the development of trauma-related distress and dissociation.",

The results showed that the data obtained via the two online recruitment platforms, the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site and the virtual environment of Second Life, were statistically equivalent to the data obtained from the college sample, on the basis of means of standardized measures of psychological stress and sleep quality. Additionally, correlations between the sleep and stress measures were not statistically different between the groups.

Keywords or attributes are generally chosen manually based on expert knowledge of surveillance. Most existing works primarily aim at either supervised learning approaches relying on extensive manual labelling or hierarchical probabilistic models that assume the features are extracted using the bag-of-words approach; thus limiting the utilization of the other features. To address this, we turn our attention to automatic attribute discovery approaches. However, it is not clear which automatic discovery approach can discover the most meaningful attributes. Furthermore, little research has been done on how to compare and choose the best automatic attribute discovery methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on the shared structure exhibited amongst meaningful attributes, that enables us to compare between different automatic attribute discovery approaches. We then validate our approach by comparing various attribute discovery methods such as PiCoDeS on two attribute datasets. The evaluation shows that our approach is able to select the automatic discovery approach that discovers the most meaningful attributes. We then employ the best discovery approach to generate keywords for videos recorded from a surveillance system. This work shows it is possible to massively reduce the amount of manual work in generating video keywords without limiting ourselves to a particular video feature descriptor.",

The OASIS images were collected from online sources, and valence and arousal ratings were obtained in an online study (total N = 822). The valence and arousal ratings covered much of the circumplex space and were highly reliable and consistent across gender groups. OASIS has four advantages: (a) the stimulus set contains a large number of images in four categories; (b) the data were collected in 2015, and thus OASIS features more current images and reflects more current ratings of valence and arousal than do existing stimulus sets; (c) the OASIS database affords users the ability to interactively explore images by category and ratings; and, most critically, (d) OASIS allows for free use of the images in online and offline research studies, as they are not subject to the copyright restrictions that apply to the International Affective Picture System.",

Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter.

Cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are two interrelated processes central to psychological inflexibility. Despite substantive theoretical rationale that these two processes impact one another’s association with emotional distress and psychopathology, the interaction between cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance in relation to psychological distress has yet to be empirically examined in the extant literature. As such, we examined this interactive effect in relation to four indices of psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress, and posttraumatic stress) in a large sample of community adults recruited via the internet (N=955). The predicted interactive effect was found across all four symptom measures, with the significant positive association between cognitive fusion and symptom measures being strongest at higher levels of experiential avoidance. These results provide support for proposals that individuals with high cognitive fusion and high experiential avoidance may be particularly prone to experiencing psychological distress.",

Similarly, gender inequality in the workplace and the sentiment that female employees are not as capable as males is an issue experienced the world over. 376 participants from India and the United States were asked to assess their level of trust in an air traffic controller during an emergency situation. The data suggested that the American participants trusted the older controller (55 years old) more than the younger counterparts (25 years old) regardless of gender. However, the Indian participants trusted the younger controllers more than the older counterparts as long as they were male. A mediation analysis found that affect mediated the relationship for the American participants but not for the Indians. This implies that the Americans were basing their trust on emotions. ",

For long-term impact, shoppers’ intrinsic motivations need to be explored. Using framing and the theory of planned behavior, the current study looked at how advertising messages framed as “avoiding a fee” (gain) and “paying a tax” (loss) can impact shoppers’ behavior to bring reusable bags. Findings from a hierarchical and multiple regression analysis showed differences in how both frames were interpreted. For the fee frame, attitude toward compliance and perceived control were important to intentions, while attitudes toward bringing reusable bags, control, and subjective norms impacted intentions for the tax frame. Behavioral intention was the main predictor of behavior for both frames. The findings suggest that a penalty framed as a tax maybe more effective in motivating shoppers to bring reusable bags.

Literature suggests there are valid facial cues that assist us in assessing someone’s health or intelligence, but such cues are overshadowed by an ‘attractiveness halo’ whereby desirable attributions are preferentially ascribed to attractive people. The impact of the attractiveness halo effect on perceptions of academic performance in the classroom is concerning as this has shown to influence students’ future performance. We investigated the limiting effects of the attractiveness halo on perceptions of actual academic performance in faces of 100 university students. Given the ambiguity and various perspectives on the definition of intelligence and the growing consensus on the importance of conscientiousness over intelligence in predicting actual academic performance, we also investigated whether perceived conscientiousness was a more accurate predictor of academic performance than perceived intelligence. Perceived conscientiousness was found to be a better predictor of actual academic performance when compared to perceived intelligence and perceived academic performance, and accuracy was improved when controlling for the influence of attractiveness on judgments. These findings emphasize the misleading effect of attractiveness on the accuracy of first impressions of competence, which can have serious consequences in areas such as education and hiring. The findings also have implications for future research investigating impression accuracy based on facial stimuli.",

On average, women sellers received about 80 cents for every dollar a man received when selling the identical new product and 97 cents when selling the same used product. These findings held even after controlling for the sentiments that appear in the text of the sellers’ listings. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that this gap varied by the type of the product being sold. As a policy, eBay does not reveal the gender of users. We attribute the price differences to the ability of buyers to discern the gender of the seller. We present results from an experiment that shows that people accurately identify the gender of sellers on the basis of typical information provided in postings. We supplement the analysis with an additional off-eBay experiment showing that, in a controlled setting, people are willing to pay less for money-value gift cards when they are sold by women rather than men.",

If these assertions of MDT are true, then these four components should be inter-correlated and predict unique variance with respect to key outcomes of deception (such as post-deception doubt and monetary loss). Participants were asked to describe a major deception they experienced at the hands of someone they personally knew. Findings indicated that all four components of MDT were significantly correlated and that the long-term deception composite of these four MDT components significantly predicted post-deception doubt (Study 1) and amount of money lost (Studies 1 and 2). Further the MDT components predicted these outcomes above and beyond how long they knew the perpetrator or how skilled the perpetrator was perceived to be. These results suggest that MDT may be useful in profiling long- vs. short-term deception and may have practical implications for observing behaviors associated with dishonesty.",

Text messaging has become a primary source of relationship development and maintenance for many Americans, especially youth. Researchers have begun classifying excessive reliance on text messaging as an addictive behavior, which may lead to risky activities such as texting while driving. This study interprets texting dependence within a behavioral economics framework of addictive behavior and proposes a novel Delay Discounting of Texting Questionnaire (DDTQ). The DDTQ involves a hypothetical scenario wherein the respondent chooses between paying for an immediate text now and waiting to receive a free text message in the future. We validated the DDTQ using a relatively diverse crowdsourced sample from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The DDTQ demonstrated expected degrees of systematic discounting and yielded higher rates of delay discounting with reward values in a within-subjects evaluation of the magnitude effect. Finally, the DDTQ successfully discriminated different profiles of possible text-messaging dependence. Collectively, these findings suggest the DDTQ is a viable task for use in studying the behavioral economics of possible text-messaging dependence.",

Findings that cooperative behavior is related to shorter decision times provide support for the spontaneous cooperation effect, although contrary results have also been reported. We show that cooperative behavior is better described as person × situation interaction, in that there is a spontaneous cooperation effect for prosocial but not for proself persons. In three studies, one involving population representative samples from the US and Germany, we found that cooperation in a public good game is dependent on an interaction between individuals’ social value orientation and decision time. Increasing deliberation about the dilemma situation does not affect persons that are selfish to begin with, but it is related to decreasing cooperation for prosocial persons that gain positive utility from outcomes of others and score high on the related general personality trait honesty/humility. Our results demonstrate that the spontaneous cooperation hypothesis has to be qualified in that it is limited to persons with a specific personality and social values. Furthermore, they allow reconciling conflicting previous findings by identifying an important moderator for the effect.",

To scale and widen the applicability of crowdsourcing, we present a technique that produces extremely rapid judgments for binary and categorical labels. Rather than punishing all errors, which causes workers to proceed slowly and deliberately, our technique speeds up workers’ judgments to the point where errors are acceptable and even expected. We demonstrate that it is possible to rectify these errors by randomizing task order and modeling response latency. We evaluate our technique on a breadth of common labeling tasks such as image verification, word similarity, sentiment analysis and topic classification. Where prior work typically achieves a 0.25× to 1× speedup over fixed majority vote, our approach often achieves an order of magnitude (10×) speedup.",

Are extreme insight experiences more likely when working on such problems? Insight research typically focuses on whether or not an insight occurs, but no research has been found that empirically explores predictors of variability in insight experience. To fill this gap, online survey data were collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (N = 253) and professionals contacted through Zoomerang (N = 246). A scale was created to measure the bothersome state, or mental itch, as participants had experienced it while trying to solve a challenging problem at work. The mental itch score accounted for variance in insight experience beyond intrinsic motivation and ideational behavior scores. An interaction between mental itch and ideation was also observed in explaining insight experience—specifically, ideation accounted for extreme insight experiences only when participants were also experiencing a strong mental itch while working on the problem. Findings also suggested that 1 mechanism through which a mental itch facilitates extreme insight experiences is through an obsessive passion for solving the problem. Key implications of this research are that (a) more research should study insight experiences as they naturally occur, and (b) measuring mental itch experience in all insight research (in experimental and natural settings) would help to increase the comparability and generalizability of different research findings.",

The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) was developed to provide a validated measure of addictive-like eating behavior based upon the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence. Recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM–5) was released, which included significant changes to the substance-related and addictive disorders (SRAD) section. In the current study, the YFAS 2.0 was developed to maintain consistency with the current diagnostic understanding of addiction and to improve the psychometric properties of the original YFAS. In a sample of 550 participants, 14.6% met criteria for food addiction. The YFAS 2.0 demonstrated good internal consistency, as well as convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. Elevated scores on the YFAS 2.0 were associated with higher rates of obesity and more severe pathological eating (e.g., binge eating). The YFAS 2.0 also appeared to capture a related, but unique construct relative to traditional eating disorders. In a separate sample of 209 participants, the YFAS and YFAS 2.0 were directly compared. Both versions of the YFAS were similarly associated with elevated body mass index, binge eating, and weight cycling. However, exceeding the food addiction threshold was more strongly associated with obesity for the YFAS 2.0 than the original YFAS. Thus, the YFAS 2.0 appears to by a psychometrically sound measure that reflects the current diagnostic understanding of addiction to further investigate the potential role of an addictive process in problematic eating behavior.",

An Exploration Through the Lens of the Gene Ontology,"JM Mortensen, N Telis, JJ Hughey, H Fan-Minogue",Journal of Biomedical Informatics,Febuary,February 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046416000277,"Biomedical ontologies contain errors. Crowdsourcing, defined as taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent and outsourcing it to an undefined large group of people, provides scalable access to humans. Therefore, the crowd has the potential to overcome the limited accuracy and scalability found in current ontology quality assurance approaches. Crowd-based methods have identified errors in SNOMED CT, a large, clinical ontology, with an accuracy similar to that of experts, suggesting that crowdsourcing is indeed a feasible approach for identifying ontology errors. This work uses that same crowd-based methodology, as well as a panel of experts, to verify a subset of the Gene Ontology (200 relationships). Experts identified 16 errors, generally in relationships referencing acids and metals. The crowd performed poorly in identifying those errors, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.44 to 0.73, depending on the methods configuration. However, when the crowd verified what experts considered to be easy relationships with useful definitions, they performed reasonably well. Notably, there are significantly fewer Google search results for Gene Ontology concepts than SNOMED CT concepts. This disparity may account for the difference in performance – fewer search results indicate a more difficult task for the worker. The number of Internet search results could serve as a method to assess which tasks are appropriate for the crowd. These results suggest that the crowd fits better as an expert assistant, helping experts with their verification by completing the easy tasks and allowing experts to focus on the difficult tasks, rather than an expert replacement.",

Message interactivity had a positive effect on ad effectiveness via the indirect pathway of perceived informativeness. These findings relate to the ELM in that they suggest that users processed information more centrally than peripherally, or that interactivity had a larger effect on consumer attitudes than authority. Theoretical and practical implications of study results are discussed.",

We study the problem of recovering the true labels from the possibly erroneous crowdsourced labels under the popular Dawid-Skene model. To address this inference problem, several algorithms have recently been proposed, but the best known guarantee is still significantly larger than the fundamental limit. We close this gap by introducing a tighter lower bound on the fundamental limit and proving that Belief Propagation (BP) exactly matches this lower bound. The guaranteed optimality of BP is the strongest in the sense that it is information-theoretically impossible for any other algorithm to correctly label a larger fraction of the tasks. Experimental results suggest that BP is close to optimal for all regimes considered and improves upon competing state-of-the-art algorithms.",

Most have been sponsored by Republican legislators and passed by states with large Republican majorities. Proponents of such identification requirements argue that they are necessary to ensure the integrity of the electoral system by reducing voter fraud. Many Democrats have cried foul, arguing these laws are motivated by crass partisanship at best, and racial bias at worst, because they disproportionately disenfranchise minorities. Surprisingly, empirical evidence for significant demobilization, either in the aggregate or among Democrats specifically, has thus far failed to materialize. We suspect strong emotional reactions to the public debate about these laws may mobilize Democrats, counterbalancing the disenfranchising effect. We find support for this conjecture in a nationally representative survey and an experiment where news frames about voter identification (ID) laws are carefully manipulated.",

The main purpose of this symposium is to serve as a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss recent developments in pervasive systems and ubiquitous networks. This conference will pro- vide a forum to exchange ideas, discuss solutions, debate on identified challenges and share experiences among researchers and professionals. UNet’15 aims also to promote new methodologies and to provide the participants with advanced and innovative tools able to catch the fundamental dynamics of the underlying complex interactions (e.g., game theory, Mechanism Design theory, Learning theory, SDR platforms, etc.). Accepted papers describe original research on both theoretical and practical aspects of pervasive computing and future mobile computing. This year, we received 94 submissions from 12 different countries around the globe: Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Tunisia, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. Of the submitted papers, we selected 39 full papers and 6 short papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation in the conference. We are grateful to our Technical Program and Executive Committees for their support.

We present both the three main developments that come together in Experimental Pragmatics (Gricean pragmatics, precise models, and formal experiments). We then present recent results that exemplify the promise of Experimental Pragmatics in two core domains: scalar implicatures and metonymy.",

We used the association between the concrete (spatial) and abstract (ideological) components of the political left-right metaphor to demonstrate that metaphorical conflict has marked implications for cognitive processing and social perception. Specifically, we showed that creating conflict between a spatial location and a metaphorically linked concept reduces perceived differences between the attitudes of partisans who are generally viewed as possessing fundamentally different worldviews (Democrats and Republicans). We further demonstrated that metaphorical conflict reduces perceived attitude differences by creating a mind-set in which categories are represented as possessing broader boundaries than when concepts are metaphorically compatible. These results suggest that metaphorical conflict shapes social perception by making members of distinct groups appear more similar than they are generally thought to be. These findings have important implications for research on conflict, embodied cognition, and social perception.",

However, there is no consensus about how the narcissists' Internet use impacts their social relations. In part, mixed findings might be explained by failure to account for two distinct types of narcissism, namely a grandiose type and a vulnerable type. In the present study, we expected these two facets of narcissism to show different patterns of associations with Internet behaviors and social outcomes. Anonymous, self-report data were collected from N = 532 late adolescent/young adult participants (mean age = 23.33, 54.9% female). Findings from SEM analyses showed that the links between narcissism and social anxiety/social self-efficacy were partially mediated by preference for online social interactions (POSI); however, the two types of narcissism show distinct links to the two outcomes. Vulnerable narcissism was positively associated with POSI, which indirectly predicted problems for both measures of social relations; in contrast, grandiose narcissism was only directly and positively associated with social self-efficacy and negatively with social anxiety.",

This is a reasonable strategy for a visual system designed to recognize objects under a range of lighting conditions, since cast shadows are not intrinsic properties of the scene—they look different (or disappear entirely) under different lighting conditions. However, cast shadows can convey useful information about the three-dimensional shapes of objects and their spatial relations. In this study, we investigated how well people detect changes to cast shadows, presented in natural scenes in a change blindness paradigm, and whether shadow changes that imply the movement or disappearance of an object are more easily noticed than shadow changes that imply a change in lighting. In Experiment 1, a critical object’s shadow was removed, rotated to another direction, or shifted down to suggest that the object was floating. All of these shadow changes were noticed less often than changes to physical objects or surfaces in the scene, and there was no difference in the detection rates for the three types of changes. In Experiment 2, the shadows of visible or occluded objects were removed from the scenes. Although removing the cast shadow of an occluded object could be seen as an object deletion, both types of shadow changes were noticed less often than deletions of the visible, physical objects in the scene. These results show that even informative shadow changes are missed, suggesting that cast shadows are discounted fairly early in the processing of natural scenes.",

We provide data showing that men have more sexually aggressive intentions toward women who self-sexualize, and that self-sexualized women are vulnerable to sexual aggression if two qualifying conditions are met. Specifically, if perceivers view self-sexualized women as sexually open and lacking agency (i.e., the ability to influence one's environment), they harbor more sexually aggressive intentions and view women as easier to sexually victimize. In Experiment 1, male participants viewed a photograph of a woman whose self-sexualization was manipulated through revealing versus non-revealing clothing. In subsequent experiments, men and women (Experiment 2) and men only (Experiment 3) viewed a photograph of a woman dressed in non-revealing clothing but depicted as open or closed to sexual activity. Participants rated their perceptions of the woman's agency, then judged how vulnerable she was to sexual aggression (Experiments 1 and 2) or completed a sexually aggressive intentions measure (Experiment 3). Results indicated that both men and women perceived self-sexualized women as more vulnerable to sexual aggression because they assumed those women were highly sexually open and lacked agency. Perceptions of low agency also mediated the relationship between women's perceived sexual openness and men's intentions to sexually aggress. These effects persisted even when we described the self-sexualized woman as possessing highly agentic personality traits and controlled for individual differences related to sexual offending. The current work suggests that perceived agency and sexual openness may inform perpetrator decision-making and that cultural hypersexualization may facilitate sexual aggression.",

Eighty photos (half women) of tenured/tenure-track science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty at elite research universities were selected from the Internet. Participants, naïve to the targets’ occupations, rated the photos on femininity and likelihood of being a scientist and an early childhood educator. Linear mixed model analysis treated both participants and stimuli as random factors, enabling generalization to other samples of participants and other samples of stimuli. Feminine appearance affected career judgments for female scientists (with increasing femininity decreasing the perceived likelihood of being a scientist and increasing the perceived likelihood of being an early childhood educator), but had no effect on judgments of male scientists. Study 2 replicated these findings with several key procedural modifications: the presentation of the stimuli was manipulated to either be blocked by gender or completely randomized, questions pertaining to the stimuli’s appearance were removed, and a third career judgment likelihood rating was added to avoid tradeoffs between scientist and early childhood educator. In both studies, results suggest that for women pursuing STEM, feminine appearance may erroneously signal that they are not well suited for science.",

Consistent with previous research, we found in two sizable samples (combined N = 1258) that parents' level of education and individuals' own cognitive ability robustly predicted a composite measure of success that included income, education, and awards. Other factors such as impulse control and emotional stability also appeared to be salutary.

In Study 1, 170 participants reported on the valence and frequency of the spontaneous thoughts they tend to have about several activities. Harmonious and obsessive passion both predicted more frequent spontaneous thoughts, but only harmonious passion predicted thought positivity. In Study 2, 232 participants completed measures pertaining to physical activity, spontaneous thoughts, and mental health. As predicted, positivity of spontaneous thoughts about physical activity predicted frequency of physical activity. Further, positivity of spontaneous thoughts about physical activity mediated the relationship between harmonious passion and indices of mental well-being.",

The validity and reliability of this scale was assessed in 3 studies (total N = 555). In Study 1 (N = 152), positive correlations between the single-item scale and 3 other conspiracy belief scales on a French student sample suggested good concurrent validity. In Study 2 (N = 292), we replicated these results on a larger and more heterogeneous Internet American sample. Moreover, the scale showed good predictive validity—responses predicted participants’ willingness to receive a bi-monthly newsletter about alleged conspiracy theories. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 111), we observed good test-retest reliability and demonstrated both convergent and discriminant validity of the single-item scale. Overall these results suggest that the single-item conspiracy belief scale has good validity and reliability and may be used to measure conspiracy belief in favor of lengthier existing scales. In addition, the validation of the single-item scale led us to develop and start validating French versions of the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale, the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, and a 10-item version (instead of the 15-item original version) of the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory.",

To address this question, we use a novel web-based task-oriented paradigm for speech recording, in which participants produce instructions towards a (simulated) partner with naturalistic response times. We manipulate (1) whether a target word with a voiceless plosive (e.g., pill) occurs in the presence of a voiced competitor (bill) or an unrelated word (food) and (2) whether or not the simulated partner occasionally misunderstands the target word. Speakers hyper-articulated the target word when a voiced competitor was present. Moreover, the size of the hyper-articulation effect was nearly doubled when partners occasionally misunderstood the instruction. A novel type of distributional analysis further suggests that hyper-articulation did not change the target of production, but rather reduced the probability of perceptually ambiguous or confusable productions. These results were obtained in the absence of explicit clarification requests, and persisted across words and over trials. Our findings suggest that speakers adapt their pronunciations based on the perceived communicative success of their previous productions in the current environment. We discuss why speakers make adaptive changes to their speech and what mechanisms might underlie speakers’ ability to do so.",

While little empirical work has studied the relationships among these concepts, philosophers have widely assumed such a relationship in the principle that “ought” implies “can,” which states that if someone ought to do something, then they must be able to do it. The cognitive underpinnings of these concepts are tested in the three experiments reported here. In Experiment 1, most participants judge that an agent ought to keep a promise that he is unable to keep, but only when he is to blame for the inability. Experiment 2 shows that such “ought” judgments correlate with judgments of blame, rather than with judgments of the agent’s ability. Experiment 3 replicates these findings for moral “ought” judgments and finds that they do not hold for nonmoral “ought” judgments, such as what someone ought to do to fulfill their desires. These results together show that folk moral judgments do not conform to a widely assumed philosophical principle that “ought” implies “can.” Instead, judgments of blame play a modulatory role in some judgments of obligation.",

These situations sometimes require us to avoid certain outcomes at all cost, for example because they are poisonous, harmful, or otherwise dangerous. We test participants’ behavior in scenarios in which they have to find the optimum of a function while at the same time avoid outputs below a certain threshold. In two experiments, we find that Safe-Optimization, a Gaussian Process-based exploration-exploitation algorithm, describes participants’ behavior well and that participants seem to care first about whether a point is safe and then try to pick the optimal point from all such safe points. This means that their trade-off between exploration and exploitation indicates intelligent, approximate, and homeostasis-driven behavior.",

Participants (N = 303) rated one of six applications for an elementary teaching position, identical apart from target gender and behavioral attribution type. Male applicants were rated as more likely to be gay, posing a greater safety threat, and less likeable (but not less hireable) than identical female applicants. Perceived sexuality and threat mediated target gender differences in likeability. Unexpectedly, behavioral attributions did not interact with target gender, suggesting that providing internal attributions may not exacerbate men's backlash. Implications for backlash theory and education gender disparities are discussed.",

Technology use is becoming more pervasive, making it more important than ever to understand which forms of media enhance communication in close relationships. People differ in which communication methods they prefer, and it is important to understand how people perceive and use various media. Our study uses an attachment theory framework to explore how people perceive the intimacy of different media and their preferred methods of communication with romantic partners. We collected online survey data from partnered individuals regarding their romantic attachment orientation, perceptions of the intimacy of various media (face-to-face, phone call, text message, email), and preferred use of those media for communicating with romantic partners. People with a more avoidant attachment orientation (i.e., who prefer self-reliance over interdependence) were less likely to prefer communication methods that are generally perceived as more close and immediate (e.g., face-to-face); however, our findings suggest that avoidant individuals prefer not to use these methods because they perceive them to be less intimate and less likely to resolve interpersonal conflicts. Our findings suggest that certain forms of communication may be more beneficial for avoidant individuals and their romantic relationships.",

In Study 1, non-Buddhist control-threat participants believed in the Buddha as a source of secondary control more than nonthreat participants. In Study 2, control-threat participants believed in the Buddha as a source of compensatory control, but this effect was found only among those indicating a religious affiliation. Studies 3 and 4 clarified this finding, demonstrating that religious individuals with a strong quest orientation responded to control threat with greater belief in the Buddha (Study 3) and Shamanic ancestral spirits (Study 4) as sources of both secondary and compensatory control.

In two studies, we showed that exposure to exemplary peer performances can undermine motivation and success by causing people to perceive that they cannot attain their peers’ high levels of performance. It also causes de-identification with the relevant domain. We examined such discouragement by peer excellence by exploiting the incidental exposure to peers’ abilities that occurs when students are asked to assess each other’s work. Study 1 was a natural experiment in a massive open online course that employed peer assessment (N = 5,740). Exposure to exemplary peer performances caused a large proportion of students to quit the course. Study 2 explored underlying psychological mechanisms in an online replication (N = 361). Discouragement by peer excellence has theoretical implications for work on social judgment, social comparison, and reference bias and has practical implications for interventions that induce social comparisons.",

Study 1 developed the measure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis; the results confirmed two intrinsic identity factors (individual and social) and two extrinsic benefit factors (individual and social). Correlations with previously established religiosity measures demonstrate the scales construct validity and that social intrinsic religiosity is independent from extrinsic religiosity. In Study 2, differential responding by Christian and Jewish participants was consistent with these religions’ reputed cultural-theological approaches and confirmed the independence of social intrinsic religiosity. Furthermore, social intrinsic religiosity was positively correlated with prejudice towards value-violating outgroups, as would be expected from an intrinsic religiosity. These results unconfound social and extrinsic religiosity and provide empirical evidence that intrinsic religiosity can be socially as well as individually oriented.",

Although people cannot willfully change their height (Study 1), and geographical entities cannot willfully alter their temperature (Study 2), number of natural disasters (Study 3), levels of precipitation (Studies 4A and 4B), or chemical concentration (Study 5), subjects believed that each is more likely to rise than drop in ranking. This bias is due to an association between a ranking’s order and the direction of absolute change, and to the tendency to give considerable weight to a focal agent over non-focal agents. Because people generally expect change to be represented in terms of higher ranks, and because they tend to focus on specific, focal targets, they believe that any given target will experience a larger relative increase than other targets. We discuss implications for social policy.",

The CRT is the predominant measure of such miserly information processing, and also predicts a number of frequently studied decision-making traits (such as belief bias and need for cognition). However, many subjects from common subject populations have already been exposed to the questions, which might add considerable noise to data. Moreover, the CRT has been shown to be confounded with numeracy. To increase the pool of available questions and to try to address numeracy confounds, we developed and tested the CRT-2. CRT-2 questions appear to rely less on numeracy than the original CRT but appear to measure closely related constructs in other respects. Crucially, substantially fewer subjects from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk have been previously exposed to CRT-2 questions. Though our primary purpose was investigating the CRT-2, we also found that belief bias questions appear suitable as an additional source of new items. Implications and remaining measurement challenges are discussed.",

One way for individuals to respond to negative feedback from a group may thus be to adjust their perceptions of the group's homogeneity, enabling them to dismiss the feedback as unreliable. We show that individuals appreciate this logic (Study 1) and that they put it to strategic use by regarding the members of a group as more homogenous when the group judges them negatively than when it judges them positively (Studies 2, 3, and 4). We underscore the self-protective nature of this tendency by showing that individuals adjust their perceptions of a group's homogeneity more when they themselves are the target of the group's judgment than when the group judges someone else (Study 4).",

From the perspectives of Self-Determination Theory and the Psychology of Working Framework, we tested a structural model with social class and work volition predicting SDT motivation variables, which in turn predicted meaningful work. Partially supporting hypotheses, work volition was positively related to internal regulation and negatively related to amotivation, whereas social class was positively related to external regulation and amotivation. In turn, internal regulation was positively related to meaningful work, whereas external regulation and amotivation were negatively related to meaningful work. Indirect effects from work volition to meaningful work via internal regulation and amotivation were significant, and indirect effects from social class to meaningful work via external regulation and amotivation were significant. This study highlights the important relations between SDT motivation variables and meaningful work, especially the large positive relation between internal regulation and meaningful work. However, results also reveal that work volition and social class may play critical roles in predicting internal regulation, external regulation, and amotivation.",

Researchers have speculated that this phenomenon, referred to as cyberchondria, overlaps substantially with both health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms. This study sought to examine: (1) the distinguishability of cyberchondria from health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms and (2) the components of health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms that cluster most strongly with cyberchondria. The sample consisted of community adults in the United States with no current reported medical problems (N = 375). Results from confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) support the idea that cyberchondria is distinct from, yet related to, health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms. Results from zero-order correlations and regression analyses suggest that cyberchondria clusters with the affective (health worry) component of health anxiety. Regression results diverged from prior findings, as obsessive–compulsive symptoms did not share associations with cyberchondria after accounting for negative affect and health anxiety. The present results indicate that cyberchondria is possibly discernible from both health anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms, while also providing insight into areas of potential overlap.",

We hypothesized that interdependent self-construal and more holistic thinking would predict stronger anchoring, whereas independent self-construal would predict weaker anchoring. Contrary to our predictions, no relation emerged between self-construal and anchoring susceptibility, and people with a more holistic thinking style actually anchored less than people with a more analytic thinking style.",

One of the most popular materials used in studies of learning has been a set of Swahili–English word pairs for which Nelson and Dunlosky (Memory 2; 325–335, 1994) published recall norms two decades ago. These norms involved use of the Swahili words as cues to facilitate recall of the English translation. It is unclear whether cueing in the opposite direction (from English to Swahili) would lead to symmetric recall performance. Bilingual research has suggested that translation in these two different directions involves asymmetric links that may differentially impact recall performance, depending on which language is used as the cue (Kroll & Stewart, Journal of Memory and Language 33; 149–174,1994). Moreover, the norms for these and many other learning stimuli have typically been gathered from college students. In the present study, we report recall accuracy and response time norms for Swahili words when they are cued by their English translations. We also report norms for a companion set of fact stimuli that may be used along with the Swahili–English word pairs to assess learning on a broader scale across different stimulus materials. Data were collected using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to establish a sample that was diverse in both age and ethnicity. These different, but related, stimulus sets will be applicable to studies of learning, metacognition, and memory in diverse samples.",

We administered surveys to university students and respondents—half of whom held college degrees—from a for-pay survey website, and we used an experimental method to randomly assign the participants to survey formats, which presumably differed in task difficulty. Based on satisficing theory, we predicted that ability, motivation, and task difficulty would predict satisficing behavior and that satisficing would artificially inflate internal consistency reliability and both convergent and discriminant validity correlations. Indeed, results indicated effects for task difficulty and motivation in predicting survey satisficing, and satisficing in the first part of the study was associated with improved internal consistency reliability and convergent validity but also worse discriminant validity in the second part of the study.

Because both outcomes are dissatisfying, we propose that these people are motivated to avoid prosocial requests, even when they face these requests in private, anonymous contexts. In two experiments, in which participants' anonymity and privacy was assured, participants avoided facing prosocial requests and were willing to do so at a personal cost. This was true both for people who would have otherwise complied with the request and those who would have otherwise refused the request. This suggests that anticipatory self-reproach motivates people to avoid prosocial requests, regardless of whether or not this self-reproach would have been strong enough to cause them to comply with a direct request. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for prosocial behavior and the maintenance of moral self-regard.",

Finding critical information buried in the literature can be challenging. In order to extract information from freeflowing text, researchers need to: 1. identify the entities in the text (named entity recognition), 2. apply a standardized vocabulary to these entities (normalization), and 3. identify how entities in the text are related to one another (relationship extraction.) Researchers have primarily approached these information extraction tasks through manual expert curation, and computational methods. We have previously demonstrated that named entity recognition (NER) tasks can be crowdsourced to a group of nonexperts via the paid microtask platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT); and can dramatically reduce the cost and increase the throughput of biocuration efforts. However, given the size of the biomedical literature even information extraction via paid microtask platforms is not scalable. With our web-based application Mark2Cure ( http://mark2cure.org ), we demonstrate that NER tasks can also be performed by volunteer citizen scientists with high accuracy. We apply metrics from the Zooniverse Matrices of Citizen Science Success and provide the results here to serve as a basis of comparison for other citizen science projects. Further, we discuss design considerations, issues, and the application of analytics for successfully moving a crowdsourcing workflow from a paid microtask platform to a citizen science platform.

The empirical application using biofuels shows that a negatively framed educational message highlighting the negative impact of gasoline (versus biofuels) is most effective in leveraging the social desirability of product adoption against its economic disadvantages. Consumer traits positively associated with the adoption of biobutanol are environmental consciousness, prosocial behavior, and openness to new experiences, whereas vertical individualism discourages such adoption. Furthermore, retailer choice attributes of location and payment convenience facilitate adoption, while retailer choice attributes based on price and servicescape cleanliness discourage such adoption.",

Intrinsic religiousness was not found to significantly moderate this relation. Finally, results from a multiple moderated mediation model showed that religious fundamentalism and spiritual well-being continued to be significant moderators when life meaning was simultaneously tested in the model as mediator of the calling-life satisfaction relation. Christian adults who live out their calling are likely to experience satisfaction with their lives due to heightened meaning, and those who are less religiously fundamentalist and who experience less spiritual well-being sense more life meaning from their callings and, in turn, greater life satisfaction.",

In contrast, promotion motivation is positively associated with risk-taking in the social and investment domains. Study 2 replicated the same pattern and provided direct evidence that promotion motivation is a strong predictor of risk-taking only in domains where there is true potential for gains.

We study the problem of seeking pairwise constraints with crowdsourcing in order to improve clustering results. Crowdsourcing is an emerging and powerful paradigm, which enables the use of background knowledge collecting from users, and image clustering is a relevant and appropriate use case. We propose a framework bringing in human intelligence during the clustering process. The key point of the framework is to choose best questions to perform on the crowdsourcing platform, gather pairwise constraints, and melt the existing algorithm and human input together. As the computation is extensive, we also provide some heuristic optimal methods, including natural transitive relations, to reduce the number of HITs of asking people. We evaluate the framework on real image dataset. The experiment result demonstrates the algorithm achieves a fairly good performance comparing to the other state-of-theart methods, and the optimized strategies significantly reduce the number of HIT.",

Thus, the aim was to determine the accuracy of sexual risk perceptions among OAs by examining concordance between self-reported sexual risk behaviors and perceived risk. Data on OAs aged 50 to 92 were collected via Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk. Frequency of sexual risk behaviors (past six months) were reported along with perceived risk, namely, sexually transmitted infection (STI) susceptibility. Accuracy categories (accurate, underestimated, overestimated) were established based on dis/concordance between risk levels (low, moderate, high) and perceived risk (not susceptible, somewhat susceptible, very susceptible). Approximately half of the sample reported engaging in vaginal (49%) and/or oral sex (43%) without a condom in the past six months. However, approximately two-thirds of the sample indicated they were “not susceptible” to STIs. No relationship was found between risk behaviors and risk perceptions, and approximately half (48.1%) of OAs in the sample underestimated their risk. Accuracy was found to decrease as sexual risk level increased, with 93.1% of high-risk OAs underestimating their risk. Several sexual risk behaviors are prevalent among OAs, particularly men. However, perception of risk is often inaccurate and warrants attention.",

In Study 2, Mechanical Turk participants were more likely to read instructions than undergraduate participants, regardless of whether they participated inside or outside of the lab. The findings support the use of the internet for sampling purposes as well as survey administration, and suggest that researchers use care when studies include non-intuitive instructions.",

These findings suggest Black candidates are more likely to succeed when they engage in displays of “racial novelty,” or counter-stereotypical behavior, provided that behavior signals closer affinity to White voters. For Study 1, we tested four original advertisements for a fictitious political candidate, in which we varied only the candidate’s race and the race of his son. The Black candidate with the White son prevailed over all other combinations, with respondents finding him the most trustworthy, most qualified for office, most likely to share their values, and most likely to care about people like them. For Study 2, we tested four new original advertisements for a fictitious Black candidate, varying only the candidate’s profession and the race of his son. We find, again, that Black candidates who display non-Black children do significantly better than Black candidates who display racially homogeneous families. However, we observe much more modest benefits for a Black candidate who practices a racially novel profession. We view these results as demonstrating that Black candidates are more likely to reap the rewards of racial novelty only when they are willing to provide a personal, rather than professional, signal of their affinity for Whites. As Study 2 shows, White voters in particular are responsive to personal (rather than professional) demonstrations of racial novelty. This affirms the logic of “New Racism,” whereby Blacks are looked favorably upon if they exhibit behavior associated with Whites, but penalized otherwise.",

In Study 1, analyses of Bing (N = 1,719), Google (N = 1,872), and Yahoo Images (N = 1,657) search results suggest that the images returned from the search query “sugar-sweetened beverage” are more likely to evoke health-related concepts than images returned from a search query about “soda.” In contrast, “soda” search queries were more likely to incorporate brand-related concepts than “sugar-sweetened beverage” search queries. In Study 2, participants (N = 206) in a controlled Web experiment rated their support for policies to reduce consumption of these drinks. As expected, strong liberals had more support for policies designed to reduce the consumption of these drinks when the policies referenced “soda” compared to “sugar-sweetened beverage.” To the contrary, items describing these drinks as “soda” produced lower policy support than items describing them as “sugar-sweetened beverage” among strong conservatives. In Study 3, participants (N = 1,000) in a national telephone survey experiment rated their support for a similar set of policies. Results conceptually replicated the previous Web-based experiment, such that strong liberals reported greater support for a penny-per-ounce taxation when labeled “soda” versus “sugar-sweetened beverages.” In both Studies 2 and 3, more respondents referred to brand-related concepts in response to questions about “sugar-sweetened beverages” compared to “soda.” We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and methodological implications for studying framing effects of labels.",

We examine diachronic relevance and its influence on purchase intent using a 3 (time frame: bump advertisements, non-bump past advertisements, present-focused advertisements) × 2 (age group: Generation X, late-stage baby boomers) between-subject design. Results show that advertisements for a fictional camera brand (i.e., Optimax) that focus on a bump year (i.e., 15–24 years) have more diachronic relevance than advertisements from either a non-bump past year or present-focused advertisements. In addition, advertisements focused on bump years elicit greater intent to purchase the advertised product than non-bump past and present-focused advertisements. Analyses show that intent to purchase the product is fully mediated by diachronic relevance of the bump-year advertisement. These effects hold across both age groups.",

Two studies found that while American participants categorized competitive goals and behaviors as masculine and cooperative ones as feminine across business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) negotiation contexts, Chinese participants' patterns depended on the negotiation context. In B2C contexts, Chinese participants categorized competitive goals and behaviors as feminine and cooperative ones as masculine; in B2B contexts, they made further distinctions, categorizing competitive goals and behaviors that are socially inappropriate as feminine, but competitive ones that are socially appropriate, and cooperative goals and behaviors, as masculine.

Given a set of egocentric videos captured over the course of a vacation, our method analyzes the videos and looks for images that have good picturesque and artistic properties. We introduce novel techniques to automatically determine aesthetic features such as composition, symmetry and color vibrancy in egocentric videos and rank the video frames based on their photographic qualities to generate highlights. Our approach also uses contextual information such as GPS, when available, to assess the relative importance of each geographic location where the vacation videos were shot. Furthermore, we specifically leverage the properties of egocentric videos to improve our highlight detection. We demonstrate results on a new egocentric vacation dataset which includes 26.5 hours of videos taken over a 14 day vacation that spans many famous tourist destinations and also provide results from a user-study to access our results.",

But the content (e.g., stories, news, information) that people transmit can be acquired in different ways. Sometimes people find content themselves, and other times people receive content from others (e.g., via email or conversation). Might these different acquisition methods impact subsequent sharing, and if so, how? Six studies demonstrate that acquisition method can impact transmission through changing how content is processed. Compared to received content, people are more likely to associate found content with themselves, which decreases processing. Reduced processing, in turn, lowers sensitivity to diagnostic content characteristics (e.g., whether content is interesting or well written), which reduces these characteristics’ impact on sharing. Thus while receivers are more likely to share interesting (than boring) content, the difference is attenuated (and in some cases, disappeared) among finders. These findings deepen insights into the psychological drivers of word of mouth and shed light on how contextual factors, content characteristics, and the self interact to drive social transmission.",

In Study 1, downward comparers downplayed their own competence to appear warmer, and upward comparers downplayed their own warmth to appear more competent. In status comparisons with counter-stereotypical targets, Studies 2a and 2b showed impression management strategies no longer diverge, but effects do not reverse, suggesting a combination of stereotype-disconfirming and target trait-matching goals. Study 3 replicates diverging strategies in downward and upward status comparisons and suggests diverging reasons for these strategies: Downward comparers perceive reason to disconfirm status-based stereotypes, while upward comparers perceive reason to match their comparison target. Together, these studies show mere status differences shift individuals' interaction goals in conveying two central dimensions of impression formation, warmth and competence.",

Here, we extended those findings by replicating the relationship between trustworthiness and the death penalty among a new sample of targets convicted of capital murder in Arkansas and by demonstrating that facial trustworthiness guides naive sentencing decisions. First, trustworthiness differentiated convicted murderers sentenced to life from those sentenced to death using a novel stimulus population. Next, we found experimental evidence that people used inferences of trustworthiness from faces when making hypothetical capital sentencing judgments for noncriminal targets presented as murderers. Finally, naive participants viewing photographs of actual convicted criminals without any additional information allocated hypothetical sentences that matched those that were actually received in court. Facial trustworthiness, but not other inferences (i.e., Afrocentricity, attractiveness, and maturity), accounted for this relationship. These data therefore suggest that perceptions of trustworthiness guide individuals’ decisions about legal punishment.",

Alertness fluctuates throughout the day and peak times differ between individuals. Some individuals feel most alert in the morning; others in the evening. Our aim was to investigate the influence of morningness/eveningness and time of testing on spatial attention. It was predicted that attention would shift rightwards when individuals were tested at their non-optimal time as compared to tests at peak times. A crowdsourcing internet marketplace, Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) was used to collect data. Given questions surrounding the quality of data drawn from such virtual environments, this study also investigated the sensitivity of data to demonstrate known effects from the literature. Five-hundred and thirty right-handed participants took part between 6 am and 11 pm. Participants answered demographic questions, completed a question from the Horne and Östberg Morningness/Eveningness Scale, and performed a spatial attentional task (landmark task). For the landmark task, participants indicated whether the left or right segment of each of 72 pre-bisected lines was longer (longer side counterbalanced). Response bias was calculated by subtracting the ‘number of left responses’ from the ‘number of right responses’, and dividing by the number of trials. Negative values indicate a leftward attentional bias, and positive values a rightward bias. Well-supported relationships between variables were reflected in the dataset. Controlling for age, there was a significant interaction between morningness/eveningness and time of testing (morning = 6 am–2.30 pm, evening = 2.30 pm–11 pm) (p < 0.05) such that there was a relative rightward shift of attention from peak to off-peak times of testing for those identifying as morning types, but not evening types. Findings support the utility of crowdsourcing internet marketplaces as data collection vehicles for research. Results also suggest that the deployment of spatial attention is modulated by an individual's peak time (morningness/eveningness) and time of testing.",

Materials and Methods: A faculty panel of surgeons (5) and anonymous crowdworkers blindly reviewed a randomized sequence of a representative sample of 24 videos (12 pegboard and 12 suturing) extracted from the BLUS validation study (454) using the GOALS (Global Objective Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills) survey tool with appended pass-fail anchors via the same web based user interface. Pre-recorded motion metrics (tool path length, jerk cost etc) were available for each video. Cronbach’s alpha, Pearson’s R and ROC with AUC statistics were used to evaluate concordance between continuous scores, and as pass-fail criteria among the 3 groups of faculty, crowds and motion metrics. Results: Crowdworkers provided 1,840 ratings in approximately 48 hours, 60 times faster than the faculty panel. The inter-rater reliability of mean expert and crowd ratings was good (α=0.826). Crowd score derived pass-fail resulted in 96.9% AUC (95% CI 90.3–100; positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 89%). Motion metrics and crowd scores provided similar or nearly identical concordance with faculty panel ratings and pass-fail decisions. Conclusions: The concordance of crowdsourcing with faculty panels and speed of reviews is sufficiently high to merit its further investigation alongside automated motion metrics. The overall agreement among faculty, motion metrics and crowdworkers provides evidence in support of the construct validity for 2 of the 4 BLUS tasks.",

One possibility is that higher social anxiety could lead to changes in sensitivity to interpersonal traits. We examined whether social anxiety moderates the types of interpersonal evaluations people make regarding warmth and dominance. We developed vignettes in which central characters systematically varied in dominance and warmth and asked two samples of participants (undergraduate students, n = 176, and online workers, n = 403) to rate their willingness to interact with, and the social desirability of, these characters. Participants in general reported stronger desire to interact with warmer and less dominant characters, and rated warmer and more dominant characters as being more socially desirable. People with higher social anxiety exhibited greater tolerance for colder and more submissive characters on both rated dimensions. The perceived similarity of the characters accounted for the bulk of these effects. Participants indicated a higher desire to interact with characters more similar to themselves, and people with higher social anxiety were more likely to rate submissive and cold characters as being like themselves. The results have implications for clinical interventions for social anxiety disorder.",

In addition, we examined the degree to which scientists, men, and women are seen as agentic or communal. Results revealed greater similarity between stereotypes about men and stereotypes about scientists than between stereotypes about women and scientists. Men and scientists were seen as highly agentic, women as highly communal, and scientists as less communal than either men or women. The higher the proportion of women in a scientific field, the more similar the stereotypes of scientists in that field were to stereotypes about women. Female participants perceived more similarity between women and scientists and judged women to be more agentic than male participants did. The results are consistent with role-congruity and lack-of-fit theories that report incompatibility of female gender stereotypes with stereotypes about high-status occupational roles. The results demonstrate that women are perceived to lack the qualities needed to be successful scientists, which may contribute to discrimination and prejudice against female scientists.",

In Study 1, participants (N = 602) provided open-ended descriptions of their desired personality changes as well as the strategies they were using to achieve these changes. In Study 2, participants (N = 578) completed these same measures and provided narrative descriptions of the emergence of their desires for (and previous) personality changes. Desired changes were quantified in a manner consistent with the Five-Factor Model (though desires pertinent to Openness to Experience were rare), whereas reported strategies were distinguished on the basis of cognitive and behavioral content. Desires to increase in Extraversion corresponded negatively with the use of cognitive strategies and positively with the use of behavioral strategies, whereas desires to increase in Agreeableness exhibited the opposite pattern. Finally, desires for change were typically construed as stimulated by specific events, whereas previous personality changes were attributed to shifts in social roles. Laypersons hold a diverse range of desired changes and strategies. In addition, different categories of events are recognized as catalysts of desires for (and previous) changes.",

Across four experimental studies of different populations and service sectors, we show that double deviation intensifies the trust violation generated by the initial service failure and that recovery from double deviations requires fundamentally different strategies than recovery from single deviations. Our results suggest that financial compensation is not an especially effective strategy for double deviations compared to the effectiveness of apologies and promises that the problem will not occur in the future. However, it is important for firms to match the type of double deviation to the recovery strategy, with apologies being more effective for integrity violations and promises being more effective for competence violations.",

Results indicate that in-person administration was largely equivalent to the randomly assigned online sample (Sona Systems) in terms of their intercorrelations, mean scores, variability, and reliability. However, the Sona sample consistently responded with strong attitudes for all measures, suggesting that social desirability may be decreased when completing these measures online. In addition, the Mechanical Turk sample differed in many ways from both in-person and Sona administration; although this nonequivalence is at least partially explained by sample demographic differences, other considerations may have exacerbated nonequivalence, including prior exposure to the measures and a desire to respond correctly.",

However, as social networking has become widespread, certain people are finding illegal and unethical ways to use these communities as means for opening the door of inappropriate online activities. Thus, they are providing an open way for cybercrimes such as cyberbullying. In this paper, we deal with the aforementioned issue as a time series modelling methodology, aiming at the recognition of bullying patterns within the questions posed by a predator to his victims. Given a set of real world transcripts (i.e. the whole set of predator′s questions), in which each question is numerically labelled in terms of severity, we first model each set of predator′s questions as a time series. The next step is the main contribution of this paper, in terms of changing the representation scheme from time series data into symbolic representation. More specifically, inspired by the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) method, commonly used in computational biology for identifying conserved regions of similarity among raw molecular data, we represent the set of signals according to a SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) symbolic representation, transforming each signal into a symbol string. The main rationale behind this adoption lies to the fact that the collected cyberbullying data can be converted to string sequences via SAX conversion, which in turn can be aligned, thus revealing conserved temporal patterns or slight variations in the attacking strategies of the predators. Experimental results, based on the clustering improvement of the aforementioned data using the extracted patterns instead of the time series data, justify our claims.",

One reason may be the difficulty of precisely measuring this emotionally laden concept that is felt easily but cannot be described with the same level of ease in a scientifically rigorous manner. The current study was conducted to define and measure this critical construct using a mixed-methods approach. A scale of hospitableness with structural (underlying dimensions) and psychometric (reliability and validity) properties was developed to measure the importance of hospitableness in different consumption contexts including, destination, hotel, and restaurant products. Several steps of scale development procedures resulted in a Hospitableness Scale with 10 stable items assembling into Heartwarming, Heart-assuring and Heart-soothing factors.",

How can we have the idea of a general triangle even though every experience with triangles is with specific ones? Classical cognitive science seemed to provide an answer in symbolic representation. With its easily enumerated necessary and sufficient conditions, the triangle would appear to be an ideal candidate for being represented in a symbolic form. I show that it is not. Across a variety of tasks—drawing, speeded recognition, unspeeded visual judgments, and inference—representations of triangles appear to be graded and context dependent. I show that using the category name “triangle” activates a more prototypical representation than using an arguably coextensive cue, “three-sided polygon”. For example, when asked to draw “triangles” people draw more typical triangles than when asked to draw “three-sided polygons”. Altogether, the results support the view that (even formal) concepts have a graded and flexible structure, which takes on a more prototypical and stable form when activated by category labels.",

Children's Sensitivity to the Asymmetries of Directional Comparisons","EK Chestnut, EM Markman",Child development,January,January 2016,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12476/full,"Adults exhibit strong preferences when framing symmetrical relations. Adults prefer, for example, “A zebra is like a horse” to “A horse is like a zebra,” and “The bicycle is near the building” to “The building is near the bicycle.” This is because directional syntax requires more typical or prominent items (i.e., reference points) to be placed in the complement position. Three experiments with children ages 4–8 (N = 181) explored whether children share this sensitivity to directional syntax. Children of this age showed an incipient preference for framing reference points as complements. Stating, “Girls do math as well as boys,” which frames boys as the reference point for girls, may therefore actually teach children that boys set the standard.",

In the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC), we assessed whether peer and crowd-sourced (ie, layperson) video review of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) could distinguish technical skill among practicing surgeons. A total of 76 video clips from 12 MUSIC surgeons consisted of one of four parts of RARP and underwent blinded review by MUSIC peer surgeons and prequalified crowd-sourced reviewers. Videos were rated for global skill (Global Evaluation Assessment of Robotic Skills) and procedure-specific skill (Robotic Anastomosis and Competency Evaluation). We fit linear mixed-effects models to estimate mean peer and crowd ratings for each video. Individual video ratings were aggregated to calculate surgeon skill scores. Peers (n = 25) completed 351 video ratings over 15 d, whereas crowd-sourced reviewers (n = 680) completed 2990 video ratings in 38 h. Surgeon global skill scores ranged from 15.8 to 21.7 (peer) and from 19.2 to 20.9 (crowd). Peer and crowd ratings demonstrated strong correlation for both global (r = 0.78) and anastomosis (r = 0.74) skills. The two groups consistently agreed on the rank order of lower scoring surgeons, suggesting a potential role for crowd-sourced methodology in the assessment of surgical performance. Lack of patient outcomes is a limitation and forms the basis of future study.",

The 65 items of four well-validated self-report measures of sexual satisfaction (the Index of Sexual Satisfaction [ISS], Hudson, Harrison, & Crosscup, 1981; the Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction [GMSEX], Lawrance & Byers, 1995; the Pinney Sexual Satisfaction Inventory [PSSI], Pinney, Gerrard, & Denney, 1987; the Young Sexual Satisfaction Scale [YSSS], Young, Denny, Luquis, & Young, 1998) and an additional 74 potential sexual quality items were given to 3060 online participants. Using Item Response Theory (IRT), we demonstrated that the ISS, YSSS, and PSSI scales provided suboptimal levels of precision in assessing sexual quality, particularly given the length of those scales. Exploratory factor analyses, IRT, differential item functioning analyses, and longitudinal responsiveness analyses were used to develop and evaluate the Quality of Sex Inventory. Results suggested that, in comparison to existing scales, the QSI (1) offers investigators and clinicians more theoretically focused scales, (2) distinguishes sexual satisfaction from sexual dissatisfaction, and (3) offers greater precision and power for detecting differences with (4) comparably high levels of responsiveness for detecting change over time despite being notably shorter than most of the existing scales. The QSI-satisfaction subscales demonstrated strong convergent validity with other measures of sexual satisfaction and excellent construct validity with anchor scales from the nomological net surrounding that construct, suggesting that they continue to assess the same theoretical construct as prior scales.

Philip Rogers, Paul Miles",IEEE,January,January 2016,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7356489/,"A comprehensive automated testing suite has been touted for years as an integral part of a software program's overall quality assurance strategy. One particular classification of tests - functional tests for web applications - is frequently automated, perhaps being the centerpiece of automated testing efforts. However, the build-out of an automated testing suite is expensive, requiring specialized software, frameworks, and staff who typically possess programming knowledge. Indeed, it is common to have roles such as that of a Test Automation Engineer or Software Developer In Test (SDET) on Agile teams these days, supplementing traditional Quality Analysts. With regard to web application tests, however, the calculus on whether or not to automate these tests is changing. Enter on-demand services - they have become available to perform manual testing as needed, without introducing delay, and are often many times faster than equivalent automated tests. These on-demand services feature test scripts written in natural language, which are executed by trained external testers when prompted, such that feedback is rapidly provided on the results of the testing. In this article, we'll explore these on-demand services (which can also be referred to as “Testing as a Service”) and provide business and financial analysis illustrating when this approach may complement or be a better alternative to building an automated testing suite for web-based applications.",

In this paper, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to evaluate the effectiveness of different state-of-the-art features used to summarize Arabic text. The PSO is trained on the Essex Arabic summaries corpus data to determine the best particle that represents the most appropriate simple/combination of eight informative/structure features used regularly by Arab summarizers. Based on the elected features and their relevant weights in each PSO iteration, the input text sentences are scored and ranked to extract the top ranking sentences in the form of an output summary. The output summary is then compared with a reference summary using the cosine similarity function as the fitness function. The experimental results illustrate that Arabs summarize texts simply, focusing on the first sentence of each paragraph.",

By applying these filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience. In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users manipulate the appearance of their pictures by applying filters to them. To investigate this relationship, we studied the relationship between picture features and personality traits. To collect data, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API. Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., relevant to hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits. Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and these picture features. Based on our findings, we also show that personality traits can be accurately predicted. This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.",

When can quantitative information change political attitudes, and is this change trumped by partisan effects? We analyze how numeracy—or individual differences in citizens’ ability to process and apply numeric policy information—moderates the effectiveness of numeric political appeals on a moderately salient policy issue. Results show that those low in numeracy exhibit a strong party-cue effect, treating numeric information in a superficial and heuristic fashion. Conversely, those high in numeracy are persuaded by numeric information, even when it is sponsored by the opposing party, overcoming the party-cue effect. Our results make clear that overlooking numeric ability when analyzing quantitative political appeals can mask significant persuasion effects, and we build on recent work advancing the understanding of individual differences in public opinion.",

We analyze the Copeland counting algorithm that ranks the items in order of the number of pairwise comparisons won, and show it has three attractive features: (a) its computational efficiency leads to speed-ups of several orders of magnitude in computation time as compared to prior work; (b) it is robust in that theoretical guarantees impose no conditions on the underlying matrix of pairwise-comparison probabilities, in contrast to some prior work that applies only to the BTL parametric model; and (c) it is an optimal method up to constant factors, meaning that it achieves the information-theoretic limits for recovering the top k-subset. We extend our results to obtain sharp guarantees for approximate recovery under the Hamming distortion metric, and more generally, to any arbitrary error requirement that satisfies a simple and natural monotonicity condition.",

Recently, however, the effectiveness and replicability of imagined contact have been debated. To the extent that imagined contact is theoretically a valuable intervention when actual contact is absent or less feasible, previous intergroup contact experiences presumably moderate the efficacy of imagined contact. The present investigation found that imagined contact effects were stronger among heterosexuals with infrequent (vs. frequent) previous contact with gays, improving their intergroup emotions and attitudes (Study 1, N = 261). In contrast, there were no such effects of imagined contact with Muslims among non-Muslims (Study 2, N = 320). These findings highlight the potential for moderators to impact the efficacy of experimental contact simulations. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

Similarly, the relationship between self-esteem and aggression is not well understood. The present research examines whether certain domains of self-esteem lead people to differentially employ direct and indirect aggression tactics. Overall, our findings suggest that people who are high in competitive types of self-esteem (mate value and dominance) are less likely to endorse indirect aggression or more likely to endorse direct aggression than those low in competitive types of self-esteem. In an online study, we found that men reported more direct aggression in response to provocation than women, while there was no sex difference in indirect aggression responses. Self-perceived mate value negatively predicted indirect aggression in men but positively predicted direct aggression in women. In a second study, experimentally manipulated mate value predicted indirect aggression in women. Furthermore, self-perceived mate value positively predicted direct aggression in women, while dominance predicted direct aggression in men. In Study 3, a replication of Study 2 using an undergraduate sample, we found that manipulated mate value predicted indirect aggression in men and women. We conclude that particular domains of self-esteem may calibrate preferred aggression tactics.",

Three aspects of emotion regulation have demonstrated the strongest relations with PTSD symptoms: experiential avoidance, rumination, and thought suppression. Given that emotion regulation has demonstrated differential relations with DSM-IV PTSD symptom clusters, the current study sought to examine these relations with the DSM-5 symptom clusters of PTSD. Participants were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (N = 403). All participants endorsed trauma exposure. Measures included the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II), the negative affect scale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-NA; included as a control variable), the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS), and the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI). A path analysis model in Mplus indicated that the AAQ-II demonstrated large effects with all four PTSD symptom clusters. Of those relations, the largest was observed for the AAQ-II and the Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood cluster of PTSD. Results suggest that individual variation in PTSD symptoms may have implications for the salience of particular emotion regulation strategies.",

In this paper, we propose the task of predicting what sound an object makes when struck as a way of studying physical interactions within a visual scene. We present an algorithm that synthesizes sound from silent videos of people hitting and scratching objects with a drumstick. This algorithm uses a recurrent neural network to predict sound features from videos and then produces a waveform from these features with an example-based synthesis procedure. We show that the sounds predicted by our model are realistic enough to fool participants in a “real or fake” psychophysical experiment, and that they convey significant information about material properties and physical interactions.",

Overall, the sweet soundtracks most effectively evoked the taste intended by the composer (participants chose sweet 56.9% of the time for the sweet soundtracks), whereas the bitter soundtracks were the least effective (participants chose bitter 31.4% of the time for the bitter soundtracks), compared with chance (choosing any specific taste 25% of the time). In Experiment 2, 50 participants rated their emotional responses (in terms of pleasantness and arousal) to the same 24 soundtrack samples and also to imaginary sweet/sour/salty/bitter-tasting foods. Associations between soundtracks and tastes were partly mediated by pleasantness for the sweet and bitter tastes and partly by arousal for the sour tastes. These results demonstrate how emotion mediation may be an additional mechanism behind sound-taste correspondences.",

On this basis, some researchers suggest that the dark traits are best represented as one global construct (i.e., the unification argument) rather than as ternary construct (i.e., the uniqueness argument). Here we put forward the dark cube (cf. Cloninger’s character cube) comprising eight dark profiles that can be used to compare individuals who differ in one dark character trait while holding the other two constant. Our aim was to investigate in which circumstances individuals who are high in each one of the dark character traits differ in Cloninger’s “light” character dimensions: self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence. Additionally, we investigated if the people’s dark character profiles were associated to their light character profiles. Method: A total of 997 participants recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) responded to the Short Dark Triad and the Short Character Inventory. Participants were allocated to eight different dark character profiles and eight light character profiles based on their scores in each of the traits and any possible combination of high and low scores. We used three-way interaction regression analyses and t-tests to investigate differences in Cloninger’s character dimensions between individuals with different dark profiles. As a second step, we compared the individuals’ dark profile with her/his character profile using an exact cell-wise analysis conducted in the ROPstat software ( http://www.ropstat.com ). Results: Individuals who expressed high levels of Machiavellianism and those who expressed high levels of psychopathy also expressed low self-directedness and low cooperativeness. Individuals with high levels of narcissism, in contrast, scored high in selfdirectedness. Moreover, individuals with a profile low in the dark traits were more likely to end up with a profile high in cooperativeness. The opposite was true for those individuals with a profile high in the dark traits Conclusions: Our study suggests that individuals who are high in Machiavellianism and PeerJ PrePrints | https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1611v1 | CC-BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 28 Dec 2015, publ: 28 Dec 2015 psychopathy share a unified non-agentic and uncooperative character (i.e., irresponsible, low in self-control, unempathetic, unhelpful, untolerant), while individuals high in narcissism have a more unique character configuration expressed as high in agency and, when the other dark traits are high, highly spiritual but uncooperative. In other words, based on differences in their associations to the light side of character, the Dark Triad seems to be a dyad rather than a triad.",

Past studies have related overperception to individual and situational factors such as alcohol intoxication, but nobody has yet investigated personality factors that may contribute to sexual misperception. The present research takes a first step in that direction by examining the relation between attachment style and sexual misperception. Two studies revealed that men's romantic attachment anxiety and avoidance predicted the extent to which men estimated the sexual interest of a hypothetical woman in a nightclub scenario. Mediation analyses suggest that this is due to both motivated social perception and cognitive bias. Specifically, men's attachment anxiety predicts increased desire for intimacy, which predicts their hope that a woman will be sexually interested; consequently, men imagine themselves as more flirtatious in the scenario, which biases them toward imagining the woman as more flirtatious, too. A similar process occurred for attachment avoidance, but in the opposite direction.",

Traditional models posit that scene categorization is achieved through recognizing necessary and sufficient features and objects, yet there is little consensus about what these may be. However, scene categories should reflect how we use visual information. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that scene categories reflect functions, or the possibilities for actions within a scene. Our approach is to compare human categorization patterns with predictions made by both functions and alternative models. We collected a large-scale scene category distance matrix (5 million trials) by asking observers to simply decide whether 2 images were from the same or different categories. Using the actions from the American Time Use Survey, we mapped actions onto each scene (1.4 million trials). We found a strong relationship between ranked category distance and functional distance (r = .50, or 66% of the maximum possible correlation). The function model outperformed alternative models of object-based distance (r = .33), visual features from a convolutional neural network (r = .39), lexical distance (r = .27), and models of visual features. Using hierarchical linear regression, we found that functions captured 85.5% of overall explained variance, with nearly half of the explained variance captured only by functions, implying that the predictive power of alternative models was because of their shared variance with the function-based model. These results challenge the dominant school of thought that visual features and objects are sufficient for scene categorization, suggesting instead that a scene’s category may be determined by the scene’s function.",

This is because tag-based image retrieval (TBIR) is not only efficient but also effective. The performance of TBIR is highly dependent on the availability and quality of manual tags. Recent studies have shown that manual tags are often unreliable and inconsistent. Most studies cast image annotation into a multi-label classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared to the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.",

Saqib",Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,December,December 2015,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-19428-8_18,"Previous research has focused on examining how differences between the services provider and the customer, whether demographic or cultural, contribute to service expectations, service quality and service failure (e.g., Baker et al. 2008). However previous research has not examined how stereotypes of the group that the service provider belongs to might play a role during a service encounter. The main purpose of this research is to examine the role of group stereotypes during service failures. More specifically we examine how stereotypes of warmth and competence influence anger and post failure behaviors. This studied adopted a 2 (competence: high, low) ×2 (warmth: high, low) between subjects experimental design. Data was collected via Mechanical Turk, a crowd sourcing website. We find that consumers experience high levels of anger when the service provider belongs to a group characterized by high levels of warmth, and that this anger leads to a desire to retaliate against the service provider. We also find that anger is likely to be experienced towards service providers from groups that are characterized by high warmth and low competence, e.g., the elderly. Finally, we find that the more competent the group of the service provider the more likely that the consumer is to experience anger, because higher levels of competence imply that the cause of the service failure was controllable.",

Studies 1 and 2 were correlational studies conducted on two different populations. In Study 1, we found that the extent to which Northern Irish Republicans and Unionists experienced shared negative experiences was associated with levels of identity fusion, and that this relationship was mediated by their reflection on these experiences. In Study 2, we replicated this finding among Bostonians, looking at their experiences of the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. These correlational studies provide initial evidence for the plausibility of our causal model; however, an experiment was required for a more direct test. Thus, in Study 3, we experimentally manipulated the salience of the Boston Marathon Bombings, and found that this increased state levels of identity fusion among those who experienced it negatively. Taken together, these three studies provide evidence that shared negative experience leads to identity fusion, and that this process involves personal reflection.",

Williams",Australian Journal of Psychology,December,December 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajpy.12110/full,"Objective: Australian researchers interested in studying psychological phenomena using Australian samples have a limited range of reliable sampling options, often limited to undergraduate participant pools and convenience samples subject to well-known limitations. To expand the range of sampling options available, we attempted to validate the crowdsourcing platform, Microworkers, as a viable tool for collecting data from Australian participants. Method: Across two studies, 122 Australian participants were recruited via Microworkers to complete a demographic survey (Studies 1 and 2), personality questionnaire (Study 2), and a standard decision-making task designed to elicit a framing effect (Study 2). Results: Providing a first indication of the viability of Microworkers as a recruitment platform for Australian participants by Australian researchers, we were successful in acquiring our desired sample size. Moreover, the recruited Microworkers samples were demographically diverse (in a similar fashion to Internet samples in general), and produced valid psychological data. Conclusion: Overall, these results provide promising preliminary evidence for Microworkers as a viable platform for the recruitment of Australian participants for psychological research, and for Australian researchers interested in crowdsourced participants more generally.",

The aim of the current study was to examine the impact of the size and shape of wine glasses on perceptions of wine volume. Methods Online experiment: Participants (n = 360; recruited via Mechanical Turk) were asked to match the volume of wine in two wine glasses, specifically: 1. the Reference glass holding a fixed reference volume, and 2. the Comparison glass, for which the volume could be altered until participants perceived it matched the reference volume. One of three comparison glasses was shown in each trial: ‘wider’ (20% wider but same capacity); ‘larger’ (same width but 25% greater capacity); or ‘wider-and-larger’ (20% wider and 25% greater capacity). Reference volumes were 125ml, 175ml and 250ml, in a fully factorial within-subjects design: 3 (comparison glass) x 3 (reference volume). Non-zero differences between the volumes with which participants filled comparison glasses and the corresponding reference volumes were identified using sign-rank tests. Results Participants under-filled the wider glass relative to the reference glass for larger reference volumes, and over-filled the larger glass relative to the reference glass for all reference volumes. Results for the wider-and-larger glass showed a mixed pattern across reference volume. For all comparison glasses, in trials with larger reference volumes participants tended to fill the comparison glass less, relative to trials with smaller reference volumes for the same comparison glass.",

The extent to which conspiracy beliefs about managers and supervisors matter in the micro-level setting of organizations has not yet been examined, however. We investigated if leadership styles predict conspiracy beliefs among employees in the context of organizations. Furthermore, we examined if such organizational conspiracy beliefs have implications for organizational commitment and turnover intentions. Design/Methodology/Approach: We conducted a survey among a random sample of the US working population (N = 193). Findings: Despotic, laissez-faire, and participative leadership styles predicted organizational conspiracy beliefs, and the relations of despotic and laissez-faire leadership with conspiracy beliefs were mediated by feelings of job insecurity. Furthermore, organizational conspiracy beliefs predicted, via decreased organizational commitment, increased turnover intentions. Implications: Organizational conspiracy beliefs matter for how employees perceive their leaders, how they feel about their organization, and whether or not they plan to quit their jobs. A practical implication, therefore, is that it would be a mistake for managers to dismiss organizational conspiracy beliefs as innocent rumors that are harmless to the organization. Originality/Value: Three novel conclusions emerge from this study. First, organizational conspiracy beliefs occur frequently among employees. Second, participative leadership predicts decreased organizational conspiracy beliefs; despotic and laissez-faire leadership predict increased organizational conspiracy beliefs due to the contribution of these destructive leadership styles to an insecure work environment. Third, organizational conspiracy beliefs harm organizations by influencing employee commitment and, indirectly, turnover intentions.",

However, the effects that pictorial and mental arid environments may have on one's estimated levels of resources for habit change are not known. Three studies examined the idea that an arid landscape is associated with reduced subjective vitality and, consequently, low motivation for change. Consistent with our prediction, the first two studies indicated that viewing pictorial images or visualizing mental images of a desert (versus a landscape with water or a control) reduced participant confidence in their ability to change negative habits. The relations between the type of environment and the motivation for change were mediated by subjective vitality. The third study supported these findings, suggesting pictorial images of arid landscapes were perceived as more depleting and stressful than images of landscapes with water but less stressful and more attractive than urban environment images.",

In an online survey (N = 486) conducted in the context of the 2012 U.S. presidential election, we drew on a motivated reasoning framework to examine how rational and experiential engagement and need for closure were related to selective exposure and misperceptions. Because previous research has focused on conservative media and misperceptions that serve Republican causes, we also looked at how conservative and liberal media exposure were related to Republican- and Democratic-serving misperceptions among the overall sample as well as respondents of each party. Rational engagement had positive relationships with media use and (surprisingly) selective exposure among Democrats. It also was negatively related with Republican-serving misperceptions. Experiential engagement, on the other hand, had no relationships with media use but was positively related to Republican-serving misperceptions. Need for closure was positively related to Republican-serving misperceptions, but not after control variables were added. Finally, exposure to either kind of partisan media both discouraged misperceptions that served the opposing party and promoted misperceptions that served their own party, although the extent to which it did so appeared to vary depending on the partisanship of the media and of the audience. Implications of these findings for theory and policy are discussed.",

Froehlich",ACM SIGACCESS Accessibility and Computing,December,December 2015,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2850442,"Poorly maintained sidewalks and street intersections pose considerable accessibility challenges for people with mobility-impairments [13,14]. According to the most recent U.S. Census (2010), roughly 30.6 million adults have physical disabilities that affect their ambulatory activities [22]. Of these, nearly half report using an assistive aid such as a wheelchair (3.6 million) or a cane, crutches, or walker (11.6 million) [22]. Despite comprehensive civil rights legislation for Americans with Disabilities (e.g., [25,26]), many city streets, sidewalks, and businesses in the U.S. remain inaccessible. The problem is not just that street-level accessibility fundamentally affects where and how people travel in cities, but also that there are few, if any, mechanisms to determine accessible areas of a city a priori. Indeed, in a recent report, the National Council on Disability noted that they could not find comprehensive information on the ""degree to which sidewalks are accessible"" across the US [15]. This lack of information can have a significant negative impact on the independence and mobility of citizens [13,16] For example, in our own initial formative interviews with wheelchair users, we uncovered a prevailing view about navigating to new areas of a city: ""I usually don't go where I don't know [about accessible routes]"" (Interviewee 3, congenital polyneuropathy). Our overarching research vision is to transform the way in which street-level accessibility information is collected and used to support new types of assistive map-based tools.",

Yet, not every frame is worthy of being captured and stored. We propose to automatically predict “snap points” in unedited egocentric video—that is, those frames that look like they could have been intentionally taken photos. We develop a generative model for snap points that relies on a Web photo prior together with domain-adapted features. Critically, our approach avoids strong assumptions about the particular content of snap points, focusing instead on their composition. Using 17 h of egocentric video from both human and mobile robot camera wearers, we show that the approach accurately isolates those frames that human judges would believe to be intentionally snapped photos. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of snap point detection for improving object detection and keyframe selection in egocentric video.",

Niezen",IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,December,December 2015,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7360328/,"Within the global cloud market, accountability is needed to help overcome barriers to cloud service adoption. A key inhibitor for movement to software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud models is lack of consumer trust. ?Potential cloud customers perceive a lack of transparency and relatively less control [on their data] than with traditional models? [1]. One way of introducing accountability in the cloud ecosystem is by means of accountability tools. These tools offer cloud customers more insight in the use (e.g., processing, storage, sharing and deletion) of their data in the cloud. Moreover, they promise to promote responsible data stewardship by both cloud providers and cloud users [2]. However, the economic viability of these tools remains unclear. In fact, it is generally assumed that people are willing to pay for cloud services that would otherwise be free, if these cloud services account for their data processes and these processes are supervised. This article explores the economic viability of one of the accountability tools and mechanisms that account for responsible data stewardship in the cloud, specifically a transparency tool. We explore whether individual cloud customers actually are interested in paying for accountability tools. Thus far, no studies exist to support this claim and the actual willingness to pay among consumers may be significantly lower than is assumed by accountability tool developers. Our investigation uses a sample of lay people and explores their general willingness to pay for a tool that offers them transparency about their data in the cloud and its use by the cloud provider and possible others.",

Hence, known biases in how individuals answer survey questions can introduce systematic errors into the social media literature. In particular, many common social media measures are prone to acquiescence response bias, an error that occurs due to individuals' tendency to agree with agree–disagree questions. The current study tests a series of techniques to both detect and overcome acquiescence bias in the context of Facebook measurement. Controlling for individuals' tendency to agree with agree–disagree questions, we find evidence that acquiescence has inflated the reliabilities and factor loadings of many Facebook use scales, and has altered correlations both among Facebook use measures and between those measures and related covariates. Further, when the individual-level tendency to agree with questions is controlled, Facebook measures demonstrate greater criterion validity in their relations to items that do not use agree–disagree scales. Having identified the presence of acquiescent responding, we test three methods for mitigating this response bias: the use of balanced scales, item-specific questions, and statistical correctives. All three methods appear to reduce the bias introduced by acquiescence. Thus, the results provide comparative evidence on strategies to alleviate the consistent impact of an important method bias in social media measurement and thereby contribute to improving the validity of social media research at large.",

Smillie",Journal of Personality,December,December 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12237/abstract,"One of the most common tools for studying pro-sociality is the dictator game, in which allocations to one's partner are often described in terms of altruism. However, the motivations driving these allocations may represent either emotional concern for others (compassion), adherence to social norms regarding fairness (politeness), or both. In this article, we apply personality psychology to the study of behavior in the dictator game, in which we examine the discriminant validity of distinct pro-social constructs from the Big Five and HEXACO models in relation to allocations of wealth. Across four studies (Study 1: N = 192; Study 2: N = 212; Study 3: N = 304; Study 4: N = 90) utilizing both hypothetical and incentivized designs, we found that the politeness—but not compassion—aspect of Big Five Agreeableness, as well as HEXACO Honesty-Humility, uniquely predicted dictator allocations within their respective personality models. These findings contribute to a growing literature indicating that the standard dictator game measures “good manners” or adherence to norms concerning fairness, rather than pure emotional concern or compassionate motives, and have important implications for how this paradigm is used and interpreted in psychological research.",

Quality management innovation is defined as those elements of TQM that specifically support or enhance innovation in products and processes. We examine these relationships with survey data from 492 manufacturing practitioners across a variety of industries. The results suggest a significant positive relationship between DFE and environmental performance, and find that this effect is significantly and positively mediated by quality management innovation.

Until now, resumes were among the most widely used tools for the screening of job applicants. The advent of inexpensive sensors combined with the success of online video platforms has enabled the introduction of a new type of resume, the video resume. Video resumes can be defined as short video messages where job applicants present themselves to potential employers. Online video resumes represent an opportunity to study the formation of first impressions in an employment context at a scale never achieved before, and to our knowledge they have not been studied from a behavioral standpoint. We collected a dataset of 939 conversational English-speaking video resumes from YouTube. Annotations of demographics, skills, and first impressions were collected using the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. Basic demographics were then analyzed to understand the population using video resumes to find a job, and results showed that the population mainly consisted of young people looking for internship and junior positions. We developed a computational framework for the prediction of organizational first impressions, where the inference and nonverbal cue extraction steps were fully automated. Results demonstrated that automatically predicting first impressions up to a certain level was a feasible task, with up to 27% of the variance explained for extraversion, and up to 20% for social and communication skills.",

This assumption, although frequently asserted, has not been empirically evaluated. And there are reasons to be skeptical about whether public opinion supports human rights foreign policy compared to other policy objectives. This article explores US public opinion about human rights, by asking two questions: Does the public think human rights should factor in foreign aid decisions and does the context—the strategic or economic relationship between the donor and recipient—affect this? This article uses results from a nationwide experimental survey to evaluate these questions. I find that the majority of respondents support cutting aid to punish human rights violators and that this depends minimally on the importance of the recipient.",

Results indicated that participants generally recognized that symptoms warranted professional help, and recognition was associated with self-efficacy for seeking mental health care, but not with participants' own symptoms. Furthermore, participants perceived psychotherapy to be the most useful coping approach. Of concern is the perception that symptoms are the result of personal weakness (particularly among male participants and for social anxiety disorder), as well as limited knowledge about publicly available resources. In all, results suggest that there are areas for growth regarding mental health literacy for anxiety disorders.",

Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a large and well-known crowdsourcing service. It has developed into the leading platform for crowdsourcing recruitment. Objective: To explore the application of online crowdsourcing for health informatics research, specifically the testing of medical pictographs. Methods: A set of pictographs created for cardiovascular hospital discharge instructions was tested for recognition. This set of illustrations (n=486) was first tested through an in-person survey in a hospital setting (n=150) and then using online MTurk participants (n=150). We analyzed these survey results to determine their comparability. Results: Both the demographics and the pictograph recognition rates of online participants were different from those of the in-person participants. In the multivariable linear regression model comparing the 2 groups, the MTurk group scored significantly higher than the hospital sample after adjusting for potential demographic characteristics (adjusted mean difference 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.28, P<.001). The adjusted mean ratings were 2.95 (95% CI 2.89-3.02) for the in-person hospital sample and 3.14 (95% CI 3.07-3.20) for the online MTurk sample on a 4-point Likert scale (1=totally incorrect, 4=totally correct). Conclusions: The findings suggest that crowdsourcing is a viable complement to traditional in-person surveys, but it cannot replace them.",

Vanman",Journal of Applied Social Psychology,December,December 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12370/full,"This study examined the relevance of disgust to evaluations of an obese target person, and the connection between disgust and prejudice toward that person. Participants (n = 598) viewed an image of an obese or non-obese woman, and then evaluated that woman on a number of dimensions (emotions, attitudes, stereotypes, desire for social distance). Compared with the non-obese target, the obese target elicited more disgust, more negative attitudes and stereotypes, and a greater desire for social distance. Furthermore, disgust mediated the effect of the target's body size on all of the outcome variables (attitudes, stereotypes, social distance). Disgust plays an important role in prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity, and might in part explain the pervasiveness of weight bias.",

We extend these findings to political ad campaigns, in which skin complexion can be easily manipulated in ways that are difficult to detect. Devising a method to measure how dark a candidate appears in an image, this paper examines how complexion varied with ad content during the 2008 presidential election campaign (study 1). Findings show that darker images were more frequent in negative ads—especially those linking Obama to crime—which aired more frequently as Election Day approached. We then conduct an experiment to document how these darker images can activate stereotypes, and show that a subtle darkness manipulation is sufficient to activate the most negative stereotypes about Blacks—even when the candidate is a famous counter-stereotypical exemplar—Barack Obama (study 2). Further evidence of an evaluative penalty for darker skin comes from an observational study measuring affective responses to depictions of Obama with varying skin complexion, presented via the Affect Misattribution Procedure in the 2008 American National Election Study (study 3). This study demonstrates that darker images are used in a way that complements ad content, and shows that doing so can negatively affect how individuals evaluate candidates and think about politics.",

Although disagreements are possible about specific issues and potential solutions, it is widely recognized that public input is needed in the development of socially sustainable agriculture systems. The aim of this study was to assess the views of people not affiliated with the dairy industry on what they perceived to be the ideal dairy farm and their associated reasons. Through an online survey, participants were invited to respond to the following open-ended question: “What do you consider to be an ideal dairy farm and why are these characteristics important to you?” Although participants referenced social, economic, and ecological aspects of dairy farming, animal welfare was the primary issue raised. Concern was expressed directly about the quality of life for the animals, and the indirect effect of animal welfare on milk quality. Thus participants appeared to hold an ethic for dairy farming that included concern for the animal, as well as economic, social, and environmental aspects of the dairy system.",

Although sex and romance tend to go together in real-world relationships, the authors find that exposure to sex-based ads decreases preference for romantically linked products and services in men. Furthermore, the authors find that the effect is one directional, such that exposure to romantic imagery in ads does not decrease men’s preference for sex-related products. Finally, the authors find that exposure to sex-based ads does not lead to a decreased preference for romantically linked products in women. The authors explain this pattern of results through the relatively opportunistic nature of the sex drive in men. They close with a discussion about implications for theories of fundamental motives and for the effect of sex-based advertisements on dating and relationships.",

Given a dataset that contains images, questions and their answers, both modules are trained at the same time, with the difference being VQG uses the images as input and the corresponding questions as output, while VQA uses images and questions as input and the corresponding answers as output. We evaluate the self talk process subjectively using Amazon Mechanical Turk, which show effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The online experimental study conducted with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (N = 73) finds different responses of attitudinal loyalty and habit towards personalization in significant three-way interactions between personalization, attitudinal loyalty, and habit on privacy disclosure and protection behaviors. When interacting with a personalized website, highly habitual consumers without high level of attitudinal loyalty disclosed the most personal information on a personalized mobile site, and displayed the least intention of protecting their privacy on their smartphones, whereas consumers with high levels of both habit and attitudinal loyalty reported the highest tendency of privacy protection behavior. However, habit and personalization do not have a significant effect on disclosure behaviors when users have high attitudinal loyalty to a brand. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

Very little research, however, has examined these sex differences and how they may play a role in nonmarital relationship dissolution. The existing literature that does examine nonmarital breakups tends to do so from a clinical perspective and neglects the evolutionary approach. The current study uses self-report data gathered from 392 participants through Mechanical Turk to expand upon the sparse existing literature on nonmarital relationship dissolution from an evolutionary perspective to investigate how sex differences in mating strategies affect breakup processes such as the coping period, emotions experienced, and post-breakup behaviors. Results revealed that women require a longer time period to get over an ex-partner with a good sense of humor and are more likely to make in-person contact with such an ex-partner. For post-breakup emotions, women were significantly more likely to report feeling happy which likely is a reflection of the finding that they were more likely to initiate breakups. Men, on the other hand, were more likely to report feeling sexually frustrated following relationship dissolution. Post-breakup behaviors were predicted by breakup initiator rather than participant gender. Overall, these findings support sexual dimorphism in the value of humor and greater female choosiness even after initial mate selection.",

Davidson",Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy,December,December 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12103/full,"Many proponents of diversity stress that diversity is good—good for universities to further their educational missions and good for businesses, for hiring talent and generating financial returns to shareholders. In this work, we examined costs of framing diversity as good for organizations vs. fair; specifically, we examined whether framing diversity as good for organizations broadens people's definitions of diversity and increases racial bias. In Study 1, White participants preferred the “diversity as good for organizations” frame and believed it to be effective at promoting diversity. In Studies 2–5, White participants presented with the “diversity is good for organizations” frame broadened their definitions of diversity (Studies 2–5) and deprioritized a qualified Black applicant (Studies 4 and 5). Participants low in resources were especially likely to deprioritize the Black applicant (Study 5). This latter finding led us to investigate the motivated nature of diversity frames. In a final study, we found that participants whose resources were threatened favored the “diversity is good for organizations” frame and devalued the “diversity is fair” frame (Study 6). These studies demonstrate that a well-intentioned plea to promote diversity (“diversity is good for organizations”) has costs; it can lead to the deprioritization of qualified Black applicants.",

Methodology/approach: The study uses a cross-sectional survey of 559 U.S. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) members using quota sampling from three generational groups: SGI (born before 1946), older boomer (born 1946–1954), and millennial (born 1977–1992). Findings: Results showed generational cohort differences in system and institutional trust as well as OBI. Serial mediation model results showed the model where institutional trust precedes system trust best explains the relationship between generational cohort membership and OBI. Research limitations: While diverse, the sample comprised of MTurk workers and relied on self-report measures of behavioral intentions, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings. Implications: This study introduces two levels of e-trust into the technology acceptance literature and provides a guideline for financial institutions and system designers to understand the role of trust in driving online service adoption and use for different generations. Originality/value: This study explores generational differences in technology use with special focus on older adults, which is yet to be fully explored in the literature. This study differentiates between two levels of e-trust and explores the order in which both trust types mediate the relationship between generational cohort membership and OBI.",

Chapman",Journal of Adult Development,December,December 2015,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10804-015-9225-2,"Research regarding the relationship between empathy and mindfulness is sparse. Within the social scientific literature, there are two major branches of mindfulness research: meditative mindfulness (Kabat-Zinn in Gen Hosp Psychiatry 4(1):33–47, 1982) and non-meditative, socio-cognitive mindfulness (Langer and Moldoveanu in J Soc Issues 56(1):1–9, 2000). Meditative mindfulness is the awareness that arises through paying attention non-judgmentally to the present moment whereas socio-cognitive mindfulness is the process of drawing novel distinctions leading to greater attention to the present moment and sensitivity to context. We hypothesized that the two types of mindfulness would correlate with each other and with empathy broadly defined but that there would be divergence in these relationships given their conceptual distinctions. Four hundred and eighty-four participants from Mechanical Turk completed tasks of socio-cognitive mindfulness, meditative mindfulness, affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and social desirability. Socio-cognitive mindfulness correlated with both affective and cognitive empathy as well as with meditative mindfulness. Meditative mindfulness correlated with only affective empathy but not with cognitive empathy. These findings suggested that, in contrast to meditative mindfulness, socio-cognitive mindfulness involves cognitive processes (e.g., perspective-taking, flexibility) potentially amenable to experimental manipulation aimed at increasing empathy more generally.",

The findings of the current research indicate that a smile alone may not be sufficient in achieving service excellence. Specifically, this work extends prior research suggesting that customers have more positive reactions to Duchenne, or authentic, smiles compared to non-Duchenne, or non-genuine, smiles. Two experimental vignette studies examined the influence of the type of smile a service provider displays (Duchenne vs. non-Duchenne) and gender of the service provider on perceptions of service quality, as well as the Stereotype Content Model dimensions of competence and warmth. The results suggest that the type of smile (Duchenne vs. non-Duchenne) impacts evaluations of service providers in terms of their perceived level of competence, as well as their perceived service quality ratings. Implications for the hiring and training of service providers are also discussed.",

All children distinguished directly from indirectly acquired knowledge (Studies 1–3), even when the indirectly acquired knowledge was highly familiar (Study 2). All children also distinguished difficult-to-acquire direct knowledge from simple-to-acquire direct knowledge (Study 3). The major developmental change was the increasing ability to completely rule out indirect knowledge as possible for an isolated individual to acquire.",

The current study examined if time-of-day preference mediates the relation between the Big Five personality traits and breakfast-related attitudes and behaviors. Results revealed that conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness predicted healthy breakfast attitudes and behaviors, whereas neuroticism predicted unhealthy breakfast attitudes and behaviors. Importantly, time-of-day preference mediated most of these relationships (except for the agreeableness models). Even when the direct effect of personality on breakfast attitudes and behaviors was not significant, all of the indirect effects through time-of-day preference were significant. Together, these findings indicate that personality differences in breakfast attitudes and behaviors are accounted for by time-of-day preference. These findings also suggest that future work should examine more integrative models of eating behavior to better understand how various individual differences relate to specific attitudes and behaviors.",

It has helped explain consequential national security decisions such as the escalation in Vietnam and the surges in Iraq and Afghanistan. While previous analysis of sunk costs in international relations has made no distinction between financial and human sunk costs, there is evidence in psychology that people treat human lives and financial costs differently. The consensus in the casualty sensitivity literature is that human sunk costs should lower support for a conflict, but there is as yet no evidence on whether financial costs operate in the same way. Using the Environmental Protection Agency’s value of a statistical life to equalize human and financial costs, we create survey experiments through Mechanical Turk and GfK/Knowledge Networks about a hypothetical US military intervention to test if financial and human costs have the same effects on public opinion. We find that public reaction to sunk costs is contingent on the type of costs incurred. Consistent with the growing ‘sunk costs skeptic’ literature we find no evidence that any sunk costs induce greater commitment to a mission. Where the US contribution to the conflict is purely financial, sunk costs induce a desire to cut losses. When intervention involves US lives, sunk costs make no difference to the level of support. Finally, contrary to the implicit assumptions of past policymakers, ex ante levels of public support for sending troops and sending money are indistinguishable. These findings hold true both in situations involving high Iraq War level sunk costs and low Somalia-style costs.",

We argue that undergoing visually salient physical transformations in the process of becoming a group member leads to particularly heightened essentialist conceptions. We test this idea in the context of parenthood. Public discourse suggests the category mother is imbued with special properties and is viewed as a deeper, more lasting, and real category than father. Such perceptions may contribute to unequal work outcomes for women relative to men. Collectively, the 5 studies reported show that mothers are perceived in more essentialist terms than fathers, and that physical changes women undergo in the process of becoming mothers play a substantial role in producing this difference. Moreover, viewing mothers as a particularly natural and real category predicted judgments that women struggle to successfully manage their roles as mothers and professionals, but only when motherhood was biological in nature. The role that observable physical transformations may play in the reification of categories is discussed.",

We created and validated an inventory of individuals’ interests in eight different types of volunteering: administrative volunteering, helping animals, interpersonal helping (autonomy or dependency), donating, physical volunteering (built or natural environments), and political volunteering. Grouping these eight types of positions into two general categories (interpersonal and skills-based volunteer positions), we also examined convergent and discriminant validity, linking interest in these positions to constructs from the volunteerism literature (i.e., prosocial personality, volunteer motivations, and volunteer satisfaction). This research demonstrates that volunteer behaviors can be classified into types, certain individuals are interested in different types of volunteer behaviors, and volunteers engaged in behaviors that match their interests express greater volunteer satisfaction.",

One substantial finding is that self-interest taints the purity of the employee’s motivation making it less likely for respondents to classify the employee as a whistleblower. The employee’s gender, the type of action protested, and whether the employee worked in the public or private sector were randomly manipulated, with no significant differences in respondents’ support or classification of whistleblowing.

However, Dawid-Skene scheme requires all the data to perform each EM iteration, and can be infeasible for streaming data or large scale data.

Further, we prove that under mild conditions, the online Dawid-Skene scheme with projection converges to a stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood of the observed data. Our experiments demonstrate that the online DawidSkene scheme achieves state of the art performance comparing with other methods based on the DawidSkene scheme.",

We propose a generative model for solving these problems of physical scene understanding from real-world videos and images. At the core of our generative model is a 3D physics engine, operating on an object-based representation of physical properties, including mass, position, 3D shape, and friction. We can infer these latent properties using relatively brief runs of MCMC, which drive simulations in the physics engine to fit key features of visual observations. We further explore directly mapping visual inputs to physical properties, inverting a part of the generative process using deep learning. We name our model Galileo, and evaluate it on a video dataset with simple yet physically rich scenarios. Results show that Galileo is able to infer the physical properties of objects and predict the outcome of a variety of physical events, with an accuracy comparable to human subjects. Our study points towards an account of human vision with generative physical knowledge at its core, and various recognition models as helpers leading to efficient inference.",

Both perceived social networking site credibility and flow were predictors of perceived focused learning while social capital affinity was a strong, direct predictor of perceived incidental knowledge gain in this sample.",

Richeson",Psychological Science,December,December 2015,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615612202,"The present research examined whether a communicator’s verbal, implicit message regarding a target is used as a cue for inferring that communicator’s social identity. Previous research has found linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) in individuals’ speech: They use abstract language to describe in-group targets’ desirable behaviors and concrete language to describe their undesirable behaviors (favorable LIB), but use concrete language for out-group targets’ desirable behaviors and abstract language for their undesirable behaviors (unfavorable LIB). Consequently, one can infer the type of language a communicator is likely to use to describe in-group and out-group targets. We hypothesized and found evidence for the reverse inference. Across four studies, individuals inferred a communicator’s social identity on the basis of the communicator’s use of an LIB. Specifically, participants more strongly believed that a communicator and target shared a social identity when the communicator used the favorable, rather than the unfavorable, LIB in describing that target.",
,,,,439,Highlighting consensus among medical scientists increases public support for vaccines: evidence from a randomized experiment,"Sander L. van der Linden, Chris E. Clarke, and Edward W. Maibach",BMC Public Health,December,December 2015,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669673/,"Background: A substantial minority of American adults continue to hold influential misperceptions about childhood vaccine safety. Growing public concern and refusal to vaccinate poses a serious public health risk. Evaluations of recent pro-vaccine health communication interventions have revealed mixed results (at best). This study investigated whether highlighting consensus among medical scientists about childhood vaccine safety can lower public concern, reduce key misperceptions about the discredited autism-vaccine link and promote overall support for vaccines. Methods: American adults (N = 206) were invited participate in an online survey experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or to one of three treatment interventions. The treatment messages were based on expert-consensus estimates and either normatively described or prescribed the extant medical consensus: “90 % of medical scientists agree that vaccines are safe and that all parents should be required to vaccinate their children”. Results: Compared to the control group, the consensus-messages significantly reduced vaccine concern (M = 3.51 vs. M = 2.93, p < 0.01) and belief in the vaccine-autism-link (M = 3.07 vs M = 2.15, p < 0.01) while increasing perceived consensus about vaccine safety (M = 83.93 vs M = 89.80, p < 0.01) and public support for vaccines (M = 5.66 vs M = 6.22, p < 0.01). Mediation analysis further revealed that the public’s understanding of the level of scientific agreement acts as an important “gateway” belief by promoting public attitudes and policy support for vaccines directly as well as indirectly by reducing endorsement of the discredited autism-vaccine link. Conclusion: These findings suggest that emphasizing the medical consensus about (childhood) vaccine safety is likely to be an effective pro-vaccine message that could help prevent current immunization rates from declining. We recommend that clinicians and public health officials highlight and communicate the high degree of medical consensus on (childhood) vaccine safety when possible.",

Experiments in ants and fishes have shown that individuals choose according to estimations of which option to take given private and social information. Principled approaches based on probabilistic estimations by agents give mathematical formulas explaining experiments in these species. Here we test whether the same principled approaches can explain social influence in humans. We conduct a large online field experiment in which we measure opinion influenced by public comments about short movies in the most popular video-sharing website. We show that the basic principles of social influence in other species also apply to humans, with the added complexity that humans are heterogenous. We infer influenceability of each participant of the experiment, finding that individuals prone to social influence tend to agree with social feedback, read less comments, and are less educated than the persons who resist influence. We believe that our results will help to build a mathematical theory of social influence rooted in probabilistic reasoning that show commonalities and differences between humans and other species.",

However, whether a similar action–omission effect applies to judgments of praiseworthiness of positive outcomes is still an open question. Drawing on positive–negative asymmetries found in other domains, we hypothesized that positive events would not elicit an action–omission effect for judgments of praise, because such positive events do not by default trigger the causal appraisal processes that are central to the action–omission effect. Furthermore, we posited that when people are explicitly asked to consider causality before or during the judgment, an action–omission effect on judgments of praise could be obtained too. These hypotheses were verified in three independent studies and a meta-analytic analysis. As such, the present set of studies provides novel insights in the action–omission effect's asymmetry for negative and positive outcomes, as well as an increased understanding of the role of causality appraisal in this effect: judgments of praise are less reliant on causal reasoning than judgments of blame, and therefore also less susceptible to the action–omission bias.",

In this study we investigate future reward discounting in prolonged grief (PG), a potential outcome of bereavement that is associated with significant impairment. A total of 75 bereaved individuals, recruited online, made a series of choices between a small amount of money available immediately and a larger amount available after a specified delay. Greater PG symptomatology was associated with greater discounting of both a small and a relatively larger delayed reward. Results are consistent with findings suggesting that individuals with PG have difficulties orienting to the future and help shed light on economic decision making processes that may contribute to ongoing dysfunction in PG.",

We conducted an experiment to examine how Americans' ACC views are influenced by four promising frames for urging action on ACC (economic opportunity, national security, Christian stewardship, and public health)—when these frames appear with an ACC denial counter-frame. This is the first direct test of how exposure to an ACC denial message influences Americans' ACC views. Overall, these four positive frames have little to no effect on ACC beliefs. But exposure to an ACC denial counter-frame does significantly reduce respondents' belief in the reality of ACC, belief about the veracity of climate science, awareness of the consequences of ACC, and support for aggressively attempting to reduce our nation's GHG emissions in the near future. Furthermore, as expected by the Anti-Reflexivity Thesis, exposure to the ACC denial counter-frame has a disproportionate influence on the ACC views of conservatives (than on those of moderates and liberals), effectively activating conservatives' underlying propensity for anti-reflexivity.",

Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., “Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena”). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bullshit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., “A wet person does not fear the rain”) or mundane (e.g., “Newborn babies require constant attention”) statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticism but rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our results also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.",

In both samples, EC moderated the mediating effect of IP-distress in the link between RS and BPD-related psychopathology. The extent to which RS was associated with BPD symptoms through increased IP-distress was greater for individuals with low EC and less so for those with high EC. Thus, low self-regulatory abilities may foster the association between RS and BPD by magnifying interpersonal distress. The implications and limitations of findings are discussed.",

The results support the existence of two groups of entitled individuals categorized as emotionally stable and emotionally vulnerable. The emotionally stable cluster reported emotional stability, high self-esteem, more positive affect, and antisocial behavior. The emotionally vulnerable cluster reported low self-esteem and high levels of neuroticism, disinhibition, conventionality, psychopathy, negative affect, childhood abuse, intrusive parenting, and attachment difficulties. Compared to the control group, both clusters reported being more antagonistic, extraverted, Machiavellian, and narcissistic.

Our work draws from the extant literature to posit that endorsement of conspiracy theories is a motivated process that serves both ideological and psychological needs. In doing so, we develop a theory that identifies a particular type of person—one who is both highly knowledgeable about politics and lacking in trust—who is most susceptible to ideologically motivated conspiracy endorsement. Further, we demonstrate that the moderators of belief in conspiracy theories are strikingly different for conservatives and liberals.",

Previous research has concentrated on two-point correlations via spatial frequency and orientation tuning. Higher-order correlations are less studied, but they may inform us about cortical functioning [3]. Isotrigon textures can be used to probe the sensitivity of the human visual system as their structure is exclusively due to 4th and higher-order spatial correlations [4]. Although artificially generated, the same features that give isotrigons salience also create salience in natural images [2]. We implemented an isotrigon discrimination task using the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) [5]. An important secondary aim was to evaluate the suitability of mTurk for visual psychometric studies as very few exist [6]. 960 HITs were uploaded to mTurk and 121 naïve subjects participated. Based on data quality, 91% of HITs were retained at a cost of $0.132 AUD per HIT. The mTurk data was compared to two supervised lab datasets. Lab and mTurk performance functions were very similar (Figure 1A) and highly correlated (Figure 1B). Bland-Altman plots were examined and the mean lab/ mTurk coefficient of repeatability was 15.5%. Factor analysis was performed on the combined data and 2 principal factors were identified. Previous studies support that the number of mechanisms is less than 10 [7] and more likely 2-4 [8,9]. The congruence between the lab and mTurk data is striking considering the unsupervised mode of delivery. In conclusion, mTurk is an underutilized platform for visual psychometric research which can produce data of comparable quality to lab samples at reduced cost and increased scale.",

This is because tag-based image retrieval (TBIR) is not only efficient but also effective. The performance of TBIR is highly dependent on the availability and quality of manual tags. Recent studies have shown that manual tags are often unreliable and inconsistent. Most studies cast image annotation into a multi-label classification problem. The main shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a large number of training images with clean and complete annotations in order to learn a reliable model for tag prediction. We address this limitation by developing a novel approach that combines the strength of tag ranking with the power of matrix recovery. Instead of having to make a binary decision for each tag, our approach ranks tags in the descending order of their relevance to the given image, significantly simplifying the problem. In addition, the proposed method aggregates the prediction models for different tags into a matrix, and casts tag ranking into a matrix recovery problem. It introduces the matrix trace norm to explicitly control the model complexity so that a reliable prediction model can be learned for tag ranking even when the tag space is large and the number of training images is limited. Experiments on multiple well-known image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for tag ranking compared to the state-of-the-art approaches for image annotation and tag ranking.",

Why do some people believe, while others are skeptical? According to the cognitive differences hypothesis, individual differences in the way people process information about the world can contribute to the creation of psychic beliefs, such as differences in memory accuracy (e.g., selectively remembering a fortune teller’s correct predictions) or analytical thinking (e.g., relying on intuition rather than scrutinizing evidence). While this hypothesis is prevalent in the literature, few have attempted to empirically test it. Here, we provided the most comprehensive test of the cognitive differences hypothesis to date. In 3 studies, we used online screening to recruit groups of strong believers and strong skeptics, matched on key demographics (age, sex, and years of education). These groups were then tested in laboratory and online settings using multiple cognitive tasks and other measures. Our cognitive testing showed that there were no consistent group differences on tasks of episodic memory distortion, autobiographical memory distortion, or working memory capacity, but skeptics consistently outperformed believers on several tasks tapping analytical or logical thinking as well as vocabulary. These findings demonstrate cognitive similarities and differences between these groups and suggest that differences in analytical thinking and conceptual knowledge might contribute to the development of psychic beliefs. We also found that psychic belief was associated with greater life satisfaction, demonstrating benefits associated with psychic beliefs and highlighting the role of both cognitive and noncognitive factors in understanding these individual differences.",

The comparison includes classifying speech utterances into six emotions (happy, neutral, sad, anger, disgust and fear), into three arousal classes (active, passive, and neutral), and into three valence classes (positive, negative, and neutral). The results show that the computer system outperforms the naive Turkers in almost all cases. Furthermore, the computer system can increase the classification accuracy by rejecting to classify utterances for which it is not confident, while the Turkers do not show a significantly higher classification accuracy on their confident utterances versus unconfi- dent ones.",

One possibility is that or in Speaker A’s utterance in (ia) raises the potential Question Under Discussion (QUD) whether it was John or Bill who left and Speaker B’s reply fails to address this QUD. A different possibility is that the epistemic state of the speaker of (ia) is somewhat unlikely or uneven: the speaker knows that someone left, and that it was John or Bill, but doesn’t know which one. The results of four acceptability judgment studies confirmed that (ia) is less good or coherent than (ib) (Experiment 1), but not due to failure to address the QUD implicitly introduced by the disjunction because the penalty for disjunction persisted even in the presence of a different overt QUD (Experiment 2) and even when there was no reply to Speaker A (Experiment 3). The hypothesis that accommodating an unusual epistemic state might underlie the lower acceptability of disjunction was supported by the fact that the disjunction penalty is larger in past tense discourses than in future discourses, where partial knowledge of events is the norm (Experiment 4). The results of an eye tracking study revealed a penalty for disjunction relative to conjunction that was significantly smaller when a lead in (I wonder if it was …) explicitly introduced the disjunction. This interaction (connective X lead in) appeared in early measures on the disjunctive phrase itself, suggesting that the input is related to an inferred epistemic state of the speaker in a rapid and ongoing fashion.",

In general, strictly proper scoring rules for categorical events only reward a worker for an event that actually occurred. However, different incorrect predictions vary in quality, and the principal would like to assign different rewards to them, according to her subjective similarity among events; e.g. a prediction of overcast is closer to sunny than rainy. We propose concrete methods so that the principal can assign rewards for incorrect predictions according to her similarity between events. We focus on two representative examples of strictly proper scoring rules: spherical and quadratic, where a worker’s expected utility is represented as the inner product of her truthful predictive probability and her declared probability. In this paper, we generalize the inner product by introducing a reward matrix that defines a reward for each prediction-outcome pair. We first show that if the reward matrix is symmetric and positive definite, both the spherical and quadratic proper scoring rules guarantee the maximization of a worker’s expected utility when she truthfully declares her prediction. We next compare our rules with the original spherical/quadratic proper scoring rules in terms of the variance of rewards obtained by workers. Finally, we show our experimental results using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",

Our research intends to better understand the performance implications of users multitasking during simple and complex tasks by examining task difficulty both objectively and subjectively. We created a web-based word search puzzle as the primary task with an objectively easy and hard version. 726 were randomized into one of four conditions. In the first two conditions, participants received the objectively easy or hard version of the primary task and did not receive any interruptions. In the latter two conditions participants received the easy and hard versions with interruptions. Subjective difficulty was measured based on the participants’ opinions of the primary task. While we did not find any significant differences in conditions with the objective or subjective divisions, however, when participants perceived the interrupting task as difficult receiving interruptions during both the easy and hard conditions helped participants perform better. This was only true for the subjective breakdown. These findings suggest that the difficulty level of the interrupting task may impact users’ performance outcome when receiving interruptions. We also found that while there was no significant correlation between participants’ propensity to multitask and performance in the interrupting conditions, when examining those who did not receive interruptions, participants’ performance significantly positively correlated with their propensity to multitask. This implies that multitasking users perform better than non-multitasking users when mono-tasking.",

However, crowdsourcing applications in the fields of design research and creative innovation have been much slower to emerge. So, although there have been reports of systems and researchers using Internet crowdsourcing to carry out generative design, there are still many gaps in knowledge about the capability and limitations of the technology. Indeed the process models developed to support traditional commercial design (e.g. Pugh’s Total Design, Agile, Double-Diamond etc.) have yet to be established for Crowdsourced Design (cDesign). As a contribution to the development of such a general model this paper proposes a cDesign framework to support the creation of crowdsourced design activities. Within the cDesign framework the effective evaluation of design quality is identified as a key component that not only enables the leveraging of a large, virtual workforce’s creative activities but is also fundamental to almost all iterative optimisation processes. This paper reports an experimental investigation into two different Crowdsourced design evaluation approaches; free evaluation and ‘Crowdsourced Design Evaluation Criteria’ (cDEC). The results are benchmarked against a ‘manual’ evaluation carried out by a panel of experienced designers. The results suggest that the cDEC approach produces design rankings that correlate strongly with the judgements of an “expert panel”. The paper concludes that cDEC assessment methodology demonstrates how Crowdsourcing can be effectively used to evaluate, as well as generate, new design solutions.",

Participants read a passage describing a deterministic universe, in which everything that happens is fully caused by whatever happened before it. They then assessed the degree to which different behaviors were possible in such a universe. Other participants evaluated the extent to which each of these behaviors had various features (e.g., requiring reasoning). We assessed the extent to which these features predicted judgments about whether the behaviors were possible in a deterministic universe. Experiments 1 and 2 found that people's judgments about whether a behavior was compatible with determinism were not predicted by their judgments about whether that behavior relies on physical processes in the brain and body, is uniquely human, is unpredictable, or involves reasoning. Experiment 3, however, found that a distinction between what we call “active” and “passive” behaviors can explain people's judgments. Experiment 4 extended these findings, showing that we can measure this distinction in several ways and that it is robustly predicted by two different cues. Taken together, these results suggest that people carve up mentally guided behavior into two distinct types—understanding one type to be compatible with determinism, but another type to be fundamentally incompatible with determinism.",

Brough, and Kent Grayson",Journal of Marketing Research,,June 2016,http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmr.14.0379?code=amma-site,"Many marketing communications are carefully designed to cast a brand in its most favorable light. For example, marketers may prefer to highlight a brand’s membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of disclosing the brand’s exact rank. The authors propose that when marketers use these types of imprecise advertising claims, subtle differences in the selection of a tier boundary (e.g., top 9 vs. top 10) can influence consumers’ evaluations and willingness to pay. Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such claims might otherwise have on consumer responses.",

In the present paper, I propose an alternative system for conducting rigorous and replicable psychological investigations, which I describe as Exploring Small, Confirming Big. I begin with a critical evaluation of the merits of NHST and small-scale meta-analyses, and argue that NHST does have a valuable role in the scientific process, whereas small-scale meta-analyses will do little to advance a cumulative science. I then present an overview of an alternative system for producing cumulative and replicable psychological research: Exploring Small, Confirming Big. It involves a two-step process to psychological research, consisting of: (1) small N investigation(s), in which psychologists use NHST to develop exploratory models; and (2) strong, confirmatory tests of exploratory models, by analyzing new and/or existing large N datasets with variables that capture the effect(s) of interest from the Exploring Small stage. I conclude by discussing several anticipated benefits and challenges of adopting the Exploring Small, Confirming Big approach.",

Given that criminal intentionality is a common criterion for legal definitions (e.g., first-degree murder), the present study explored whether grammatical aspect may also impact legal judgments. In a series of four experiments participants were provided with a legal definition and a description of a crime in which the grammatical aspect of provocation and murder events were manipulated. Participants were asked to make a decision (first- vs. second-degree murder) and then indicate factors that impacted their decision. Findings suggest that legal judgments can be affected by grammatical aspect but the most robust effects were limited to temporal dynamics (i.e., imperfective aspect results in more murder actions than perfective aspect), which may in turn influence other representational systems (i.e., number of murder actions positively predicts perceived intentionality). In addition, findings demonstrate that the influence of grammatical aspect on situation model construction and evaluation is dependent upon the larger linguistic and semantic context. Together, the results suggest grammatical aspect has indirect influences on legal judgments to the extent that variability in aspect changes the features of the situation model that align with criteria for making legal judgments.",

Materialism as a theoretical paradigm assumes that all things in the world are tied to physical processes and matter. Yet within digital media studies, the understanding of what should be the core object of a materialist analysis is debated. This paper proposes to untangle some of the principal theoretical propositions that compose the field of digital materialism. It outlines six frameworks that share the assumption that digital stuff is composed of material entities: the Berlin School of media, the field of software studies, the literary critique of electronic texts, the forensic approach, the ‘new materialist’ media ecology, and the field of Marxian critical studies. These different options are positioned along three main lines of tensions: between a semantic and an engineer’s perspective on media, between technological and social determinism, and between critical or post-humanist political propositions.",

When reminded about the opportunity costs of time and money, consumers act to save time but not money when they acquire an experiential possession, and they act to save money but not time when they acquire a material possession. Process tests show that when a consumer acquires a possession that is both material and experiential in nature, her focus shifts to the possession's experiential (material) features when she is reminded about her time's (money's) opportunity cost, and it is this shift in her mindset which leads her to favor saving time over money (saving money over time) to acquire the possession.",

Unlike online markets, situated crowdsourcing markets consist of workers who become serendipitously available for work in a particular location and context. So far, the literature has lacked a systematic study of task performance and uptake in such markets under varying incentives. In a 3-week field study, we demonstrate that in a situated crowdsourcing market, task uptake and accuracy are generally comparable with online markets. We also show that increasing task rewards in situated crowdsourcing leads to increased task uptake but not accuracy, while decreasing task rewards leads to decreases in both task uptake and accuracy.",

Then, in two experiments set during the 2012 campaign and a later study with prospective 2016 candidates, we find flag exposure provides modest but consistent benefits for Republican candidates among voters high in symbolic patriotism, racial prejudice, and Republican identification. These effects arise regardless of which candidate appears with the flag. Taken together, our results speak to both the power and limitations of the American flag in electioneering. Beyond practical implications for campaigns, these studies emphasize the heterogeneity of citizens’ reactions to visual political symbols and highlight potent links between symbolic attitudes and a nation's flag.",

In spite of prior work, the impact of social trust on relational trust—or what Russell Hardin (2002) calls trust as a three-part relation where actor A trusts actor B with reference to matter Y—is not well established. Four vignette experiments were administered to Amazon.com Mechanical Turk workers (N = 1388 and N = 1419) and to public university undergraduate students (N = 995 and N = 956) in order to investigate the relationship between social trust and relational trust. Measures of general social trust and particular social trust produced statistically equivalent effects that were positively associated with relational trust. Political trust, however, was statistically unrelated to relational trust. These results support the idea that people rely on schemas and stereotypes concerned with the general cooperativeness and helpfulness of others when forming beliefs about another person's trustworthiness with respect to a particular matter at hand.",

Responses indicate that participants hold nuanced opinions on security and privacy trade-offs, with most recognizing legitimate uses for the practice, but also concerned about threats from hackers or government surveillance. There is strong support for notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic, although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge. We also find that a small but significant number of participants are jaded by the current state of affairs and have lost any expectation of privacy.",

There are few urologists in rural areas, often necessitating that patients travel hours to receive follow-up care multiple times per year. We plan to train registered nurses and allied health professionals to perform cystoscopies which are monitored and interpreted in real-time by board-certified urologists. The key is to ensure optimal picture resolution to guarantee this technology is not inferior to traditional cystoscopy. Our objective was to develop the technical infrastructure needed for a tele-cystoscopy system through assessment of the transmitted video quality using expert reviewers and crowd-sourcing. Methods: All combinations of the tele-cystoscopy system were systematically tested using a single Thiel cadaver. The videos were reviewed by expert urologists and general reviewers using a crowd-sourcing website. The video quality responses were assessed to determine concordance between each set of reviewers, and to determine the optimal equipment that should be selected for the tele-cystoscopy system. Results: Of eight equipment combinations, only two were of high enough quality to be appropriate for medical use. We found there to be strong concordance of responses between the expert and crowd-sourced responses. The trade-offs between cost and tele-cystoscopy system component quality were compared with efficiency frontiers to elucidate the optimal system. Discussion: We created and tested the feasibility of a tele-cystoscopy system that was deemed suitable for medical diagnosis by a group of experts. We further validated tele-cystoscopy video quality using both experts and recently validated crowd-sourcing.",

We hypothesized that emotion regulation (ER) is such a mechanism, with outcomes of individuals’ ER efforts sensitive to the social context, and individuals’ ER strategy repertoire and use sensitive to social influence. In Study 1, a longitudinal study of community adults (N = 1,319), associations of individuals’ ER strategies with depressive symptoms depended on social connectedness and romantic relationship status (social context hypothesis). Moreover, associations of social connectedness and relationship status with symptoms were accounted for by maladaptive ER concurrently and, for social connectedness, prospectively over 1 year (social influence hypothesis). Study 2a, using a national sample (N = 772), replicated and extended these findings with a broader array of ER strategies, and ruled out alternative explanations regarding social skills and psychological wellbeing. Among participants in romantic relationships (Study 2b; N = 558), intimacy and trust buffered associations of maladaptive ER strategies with symptoms (context), and maladaptive and adaptive ER mediated links between relationship variables and symptoms (influence). Findings suggest that close relationships—and variation in underlying relational processes within relationships—influence the ER strategies people use, and also affect whether individuals’ own ER repertoires contribute to depression when deployed. Results elucidate core social mechanisms of ER in terms of both basic processes and depressive psychopathology, suggest ER is a channel through which social factors affect internal functioning and mental health, and inform relationship pathways for clinical intervention.",

Time perspectives and their associated socioemotional motivations have been shown to influence information processing and memory, such that motivation-consistent information is more likely to be remembered and evaluated more positively. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of motivation-consistent mental health information on memory for and evaluations of this information, as well as help-seeking attitudes and intentions to seek mental health services. Method: We randomly assigned an Internet-based sample of 160 younger (18–25) and 175 older (60–89) adults to read a mental health information pamphlet that emphasized time perspectives and motivations relevant to either young adulthood (future-focused) or late adulthood (present-focused). Participants completed measures assessing their time perspective, memory for and subjective evaluation of the pamphlet, and help-seeking attitudes and intentions. Results: The time perspective manipulation had no effect on memory for pamphlet information or help-seeking attitudes and intentions. There was, however, a significant interaction between time perspective and pamphlet version on the rated liking of the pamphlet. Conclusion: Although motivation-consistent information only affected perceptions of that information for present-focused (mostly older) individuals, this finding has important implications for enhancing older adults’ mental health literacy.",

To develop these stimuli, ten undergraduate theater students were recruited to portray members of an audience. This audience was configured to display (seven) varying configurations of social feedback, ranging from unequivocally approving to unequivocally disapproving (including three different versions of balanced/neutral scenes). Validity data were obtained from 383 adult participants recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Each participant viewed three randomly assigned scenes and provided a rating of the perceived criticalness of each scene. Results indicate that the SCENES reflect the intended range of emotionality, and pairwise comparisons suggest that the SCENES capture distinct levels of critical feedback. Overall, the SCENES stimuli set represents a publicly available (www.scenesstimuli.com) resource for researchers interested in measuring social cognition in the presence of dynamic and naturalistic social stimuli.",

They validate the proposed framework with data from 120 companies over two time periods, and they develop strategies to help firms raise their levels of CE and EE to improve performance. They also observe that the influence of EE on CE is moderated by employee empowerment, type of firm (business-to-business [B2B] vs. business-to-consumer [B2C]), and nature of industry (manufacturing vs. service); in particular, this effect is stronger for B2B (vs. B2C) firms and service (vs. manufacturing) firms.

Furthermore, the effect of CE and EE on performance is enhanced for B2B (vs. B2C) and for service (vs. manufacturing) firms.",

Considerably less attention has been paid to the impact of stereotype threat on older adults' subjective assessments of their own abilities or to the impact of stereotype threat in noncognitive domains. Objective:Older adults are stereotyped as having experienced not only cognitive declines, but physical declines as well. The current study tested the prediction that stereotype threat can negatively influence older adults' subjective hearing abilities. Methods: To test this, 115 adults (mean age 50.03 years, range 41-67) read either a positive or negative description about how aging affects hearing. All participants then answered a questionnaire in which they assessed their own hearing abilities. Results: The impact of stereotype threat on self-reported hearing was moderated by chronological age. Participants in their 40s and early 50s were unaffected by the stereotype threat manipulation. In contrast, participants in their late 50s and 60s rated their hearing as being subjectively worse when under stereotype threat. Conclusion: The current study provides a clear demonstration that stereotype threat negatively impacts older adults' subjective assessments of their own abilities. It is also the first study to demonstrate an effect of stereotype threat within the domain of hearing. These results have important implications for researchers investigating age-related hearing decline. Stereotype threat can lead to overestimation of the prevalence of age-related hearing decline. It can also serve as a confounding variable when examining the psychosocial correlates of hearing loss. Because of this, researchers studying age-related hearing loss should aim to provide a stereotype threat-free testing environment and also include assessments of stereotype threat within their studies.",

Individualism and collectivism are linked, respectively, to independent and interdependent patterns of self-construal. These patterns of self-construal may promote corresponding cultural differences in self-complexity. However, this possibility is contingent on self-complexity arising from the same interpersonal processes that contribute to self-construal. If, instead, self-complexity arises from intrapersonal processes like cognition and memory, then it is possible self-complexity may not vary across cultures. In Study 1, we compared a sample of Chinese-born students studying in the U.S. to U.S.-born students and found that the Chinese students had lower self-complexity. In Study 2, we compared adult Indian respondents to adult U.S. respondents and found no differences.

We argue each of these can manifest with negative outgroup evaluations: Assimilationism demands that subordinate groups adopt dominant group norms to minimize group distinctions; segregationism holds that groups should occupy separate spheres. Parallel versions can be identified for intergender relations. Scales to measure all four ideologies are developed both for ethnicity (Studies 1 and 2) and gender (Studies 3 and 4). Results demonstrate that the ideologies can be reliably measured, that the hypothesized four-factor models are superior to alternative models with fewer factors, and that the ideologies relate as predicted to the importance ascribed to group distinctions, subordinate group evaluations, and solution preferences for intergroup conflict scenarios. We argue that this fourfold model can help clarify theory and measurement, allowing a more nuanced assessment of ideological attitudes.",

We end by assessing the challenges of this data collection strategy and discussing how large-scale social media data may benefit demographic researchers.",

Kalmoe",Political Research Quarterly,,October 2015,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912915608947,"How do messages from political elites interact with individual traits of citizens to spur intergroup aggression? Building on research in social psychology, we expect that in places of protracted conflict, violent rhetoric from elites will be enough to mobilize antagonism toward an outgroup, especially among those who are generally less apt to be hostile toward the outgroup. We present results from two large survey experiments, the first conducted with young Jewish-Israeli adults across Israel and the second with a nationally diverse sample of adults in India. The results show that mild “fighting” words (e.g. “battle,” “fight”), combined with a reference to the outgroup, provoke significantly greater support for policies that harm the outgroup among some citizens. This effect is largest among individuals low in outgroup prejudice and low in aggressive personality traits, people who are usually less inclined to support policies that hurt the outgroup. Effects of violent rhetoric persist even with policies and rhetoric to help the outgroup. This work highlights the importance of considering both individual traits and contextual factors together to understand their full impact in the study of intergroup conflict.",

Many commercial media companies have used Twitter as an effective online tool to broadcast breaking news. Consequently, the tweets are organized in chronological order. In this paper, we investigate the tweet exhibition problem from a new perspective. We treat Twitter as an important source of knowledge gaining and exploit its semantic attributes. In particular, we focus on extracting and distilling knowledge from tweets and proposing a new organization and visualization tool to exhibit the tweets in a semantic manner. We conducted our experiments on Amazon Turk and the user feedback from crowd demonstrated the effectiveness of our new Twitter visualization tool.",

Equipped with the current advancement in automated speech synthesis, our attacker can build a very close model of a victim’s voice after learning only a very limited number of samples in the victim’s voice (e.g., mined through the Internet, or recorded via physical proximity). Specifically, the attacker uses voice morphing techniques to transform its voice – speaking any arbitrary message – into the victim’s voice. We examine the aftermaths of such a voice impersonation capability against two important applications and contexts: (1) impersonating the victim in a voice-based user authentication system, and (2) mimicking the victim in arbitrary speech contexts (e.g., posting fake samples on the Internet or leaving fake voice messages). We develop our voice impersonation attacks using an off-the-shelf voice morphing tool, and evaluate their feasibility against state-of-the-art automated speaker verification algorithms (application 1) as well as human verification (application 2). Our results show that the automated systems are largely ineffective to our attacks. The average rates for rejecting fake voices were under 10–20% for most victims. Even human verification is vulnerable to our attacks. Based on two online studies with about 100 users, we found that only about an average 50 % of the times people rejected the morphed voice samples of two celebrities as well as briefly familiar users.",

We used a large (N = 515) online sample to replicate the findings that inattentional blindness increases with age and with the distance of the unexpected object from the focus of attention. Critically, we assessed whether distance moderates the relationship between age and noticing. We replicated both age and distance effects, but found no age by distance interaction. These findings disconfirm a plausible explanation for age differences in noticing (restricted field of view), while for the first time highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using Mechanical Turk for the study of cognitive aging.",

Crano",Addictive Behaviors,,February 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460315300368,"Introduction: Research on vested interest theory (VIT) indicates that the importance and hedonic relevance of attitudes moderates the link between attitudes and attitude-congruent behavior. Though largely untested in prevention research, this relationship may prove crucial in determining the success or failure of prevention efforts. The current study was designed to determine if subjectively perceived vested interest maximized the association between attitudes and intentions regarding the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NUPS). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with college student respondents (N = 162) using Amazon's MTurk. Participant age ranged from 19 to 49 years old. A subsample analysis (n = 129) was also conducted with younger respondents, as the typical college student is usually under the age of 30. Results: Four-step hierarchical regression analysis indicated that both attitudes and perceived vested interest were significantly associated with NUPS behavioral intentions (p < .001). Further, vested interest moderated the relationship between stimulant-related attitudes and usage intentions (p < .001). Attitudes were significantly associated with intentions of moderately and highly vested respondents (p < .001), but not those of participants expressing low levels of perceived vested interest. Conclusions: Findings support the proposition that vested interest may be a useful target for attenuating NUPS. Rather than attempting to weaken positive attitudes toward NUPS, campaigns may prove more successful if designed to convince receivers that NUPS is not in their best interest.",

Crowdsourcing is the harnessing of the abilities of many people to complete a specific task or a set of tasks. In this study multiple samples of crowdsourced individuals were asked to rate and select supporting quotes from two different transcripts. The findings indicate that the different crowdsourced samples produced nearly identical ratings of the transcripts, and were able to consistently select the same supporting text from the transcripts. These findings suggest that crowdsourcing, with further development, can potentially be used as a mixed method tool to offer a supplemental perspective on transcribed interviews.",

Andersen",Plos,,October 2015,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139198,"Few studies have examined the rates of childhood victimization among individuals who identify as “mostly heterosexual” (MH) in comparison to other sexual orientation groups. For the present study, we utilized a more comprehensive assessment of adverse childhood experiences to extend prior literature by examining if MH individuals’ experience of victimization more closely mirrors that of sexual minority individuals or heterosexuals. Heterosexual (n = 422) and LGB (n = 561) and MH (n = 120) participants were recruited online. Respondents completed surveys about their adverse childhood experiences, both maltreatment by adults (e.g., childhood physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and childhood household dysfunction) and peer victimization (i.e., verbal and physical bullying). Specifically, MH individuals were 1.47 times more likely than heterosexuals to report childhood victimization experiences perpetrated by adults. These elevated rates were similar to LGB individuals. Results suggest that rates of victimization of MH groups are more similar to the rates found among LGBs, and are significantly higher than heterosexual groups. Our results support prior research that indicates that an MH identity falls within the umbrella of a sexual minority, yet little is known about unique challenges that this group may face in comparison to other sexual minority groups.",

Wolf",Journal of Clinical Psychology,,October 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.22231/full,"Objective: Unemployment has consistently been linked to an elevated risk for depression. Exercise, specifically leisure-based physical activities, has received increasing attention as alternative treatment options. However, because leisure activities are pursued during discretionary time, it is unclear if the mental health benefits of physical and leisure activities apply during times of unemployment as well. Method: Depressive symptoms and participation in recreational activities were assessed in 142 employed and 158 unemployed participants (age = 34 ± 11 years; male = 150). Results: Independent of employment status, all recreational activities were inversely associated with depressive symptoms. However, social (employed: ηp2 = .21; unemployed: ηp2 = .11) and self-focused (employed: ηp2 = .19; unemployed: ηp2 = .10) recreational activities were more strongly related to depressive symptoms than exercise (employed: ηp2 = .12; unemployed: ηp2 > .05). Conclusion: These findings highlight the strong mental health associations of recreational activities and suggest that, particularly for unemployed individuals, promoting recreational activities, rather than exercise, may leverage the stronger negative relationship with risk of depression.",

Extracting information from the integrated smart phone sensors, such as motion, light and proximity, is a common technique for phone placement detection. In this paper, the efficiency of an accelerometer-only solution is explored, and it is investigated whether the phone position can be detected with high accuracy by analyzing the movement, orientation and rotation changes. The impact of these changes on the performance is analyzed individually and both in combination to explore which features are more efficient, whether they should be fused and, if yes, how they should be fused. Using three different datasets, collected from 35 people from eight different positions, the performance of different classification algorithms is explored. It is shown that while utilizing only motion information can achieve accuracies around 70%, this ratio increases up to 85% by utilizing information also from orientation and rotation changes. The performance of an accelerometer-only solution is compared to solutions where linear acceleration, gyroscope and magnetic field sensors are used, and it is shown that the accelerometer-only solution performs as well as utilizing other sensing information. Hence, it is not necessary to use extra sensing information where battery power consumption may increase. Additionally, I explore the impact of the performed activities on position recognition and show that the accelerometer-only solution can achieve 80% recognition accuracy with stationary activities where movement data are very limited. Finally, other phone placement problems, such as in-pocket and on-body detections, are also investigated, and higher accuracies, ranging from 88% to 93%, are reported, with an accelerometer-only solution.",

In this work, we are looking at this question from a data-driven perspective, by learning the perception of visual realism directly from large amounts of unlabeled data. In particular, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that distinguishes natural photographs from automatically generated composite images. The model learns to predict visual realism of a scene in terms of color, lighting and texture compatibility, without any human annotations pertaining to it. Our model outperforms previous works that rely on hand-crafted heuristics for the task of classifying realistic vs. unrealistic photos. Furthermore, we apply our learned model to compute optimal parameters of a compositing method, to maximize the visual realism score predicted by our CNN model. We demonstrate its advantage against existing methods via a human perception study",

Results revealed that increased preferences for Dark/Alternative and Aesthetic/Musical media genres, as well as decreased preferences for Communal/Popular media genres, mediated the association between Openness to Experience and liberalism. In contrast, greater preferences for Communal/Popular and Thrilling/Action genres, as well as lower preferences for Dark/Alternative and Aesthetic/Musical genres mediated the link between Conscientiousness and conservatism.",

Because of their impact, manufacturers and retailers are highly concerned with customer feedback and reviews. Reliance on online reviews gives rise to the potential concern that wrongdoers may create false reviews to artificially promote or devalue products and services. This practice is known as Opinion (Review) Spam, where spammers manipulate and poison reviews (i.e., making fake, untruthful, or deceptive reviews) for profit or gain. Since not all online reviews are truthful and trustworthy, it is important to develop techniques for detecting review spam. By extracting meaningful features from the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP), it is possible to conduct review spam detection using various machine learning techniques. Additionally, reviewer information, apart from the text itself, can be used to aid in this process. In this paper, we survey the prominent machine learning techniques that have been proposed to solve the problem of review spam detection and the performance of different approaches for classification and detection of review spam. The majority of current research has focused on supervised learning methods, which require labeled data, a scarcity when it comes to online review spam. Research on methods for Big Data are of interest, since there are millions of online reviews, with many more being generated daily. To date, we have not found any papers that study the effects of Big Data analytics for review spam detection. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a strong and comprehensive comparative study of current research on detecting review spam using various machine learning techniques and to devise methodology for conducting further investigation.",

Methods: Participants ( n = 327, mean age 24.8 years, 62.1% male, 77.6% white, 67.8% used waterpipe monthly, 26.4% weekly, 5.8% daily) were recruited online and randomized to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Control condition viewing no messages; (2) Harms condition viewing messages about harms of waterpipe tobacco; (3) Harms and addiction condition viewing messages about harms and addictiveness of waterpipe tobacco. Outcomes included perceived harm and addictiveness of waterpipe, worry about harm and addiction, and desire to quit. Results: Compared to the control condition, participants in the harms condition reported significantly greater perceived harm and addictiveness of waterpipe relative to cigarettes, perceived risk of harm and addiction, worry about harm and addiction, and desire to quit. There were few significant differences in these outcomes between participants in the harms condition and the harms and addiction condition. Mediation analyses suggest waterpipe tobacco use harm messages may increase desire to quit by producing greater worry about harm and addiction. Conclusions: Brief education messages about waterpipe tobacco use harm increased young adult’s perceptions of harm and addictiveness of waterpipe tobacco use and generated stronger desire to quit. The waterpipe tobacco use addiction messages tested had little added impact. Studies should prospectively examine the real-world impact of waterpipe tobacco use harm messages and investigate more effective strategies for designing addiction messages. Implications: This study demonstrates that brief education messages about waterpipe tobacco use harm can increase young adult waterpipe tobacco user’s perceptions of harm and addictiveness of waterpipe tobacco use and generate stronger desire to quit. The findings indicate messages on addictiveness of waterpipe tobacco use have no added impact on these outcomes.",

We compare our system with human performance and a predefined optimal classifier using a validated benchmark data-set.",

This article addresses how people think about different kinds of causal explanations in legal decision-making contexts. Three studies involving a total of 600 Mechanical Turk and university participants found that genetic, versus environmental, explanations of criminal behavior lead people to view the applicability of various defense claims differently, perceive the perpetrator's mental state differently, and draw different causal attributions. Moreover, mediation and path analyses highlight the double-edged nature of genetic attributions-they simultaneously reduce people's perception of the perpetrator's sense of control while increasing people's tendencies to attribute the cause to internal factors and to expect the perpetrator to reoffend. These countervailing relations, in turn, predict sentencing in opposite directions, although no overall differences in sentencing or ultimate verdicts were found.",

Given that guided mindfulness meditations (MM) frequently involve focused imagery and are typically experienced as pleasant, we predicted that visual and embodied imagery vividness would mediate the association between mindful observing traits and pleasant experiences in response to guided MM. Study objectives and methods:137 undergraduate students and 371 participants from Amazon's MTurk web service completed questionnaire measures of mindfulness traits and multisensory imagery vividness. They then completed an 8-10 min MM involving guided imagery of visualizing and embodying the positive characteristics of natural objects (a mountain, sun, or tree). Participants rated the level of imagery vividness they experienced in the visual and embodied modalities as well as their emotional responses to the MM. Results:Mindful “observing” correlated with increased imagery vividness, both in response to standardized questionnaire and a guided MM. As predicted, vividness of visual and particularly embodied imagery mediated the association between trait mindful observing and experienced pleasantness in response to the MM. Conclusions:Individual differences in vividness of visual and embodied imagery are a construct of relevance to understanding mindfulness both as a state and trait.",

The prototyping tools of a rising Maker Movement are enabling the next generation of artists, designers, educators, and engineers to bootstrap from napkin sketch to functional prototype. However for technical novices, the process of including electronic components in prototypes can hamper the creative process with technical details. Software and electronic modules can reduce the amount of work a designer must perform in order to express an idea, by condensing the number of choices into a physical and cognitive “chunk.” What are the core building blocks that might make up electronics toolkits of the future, and what are the key affordances? We present the idea that modularity, the ability to freely recombine elements, is a key affordance for novice prototyping with electronics. We present the results of a creative prototyping experiment (N = 86) that explores how tool modularity influences the creative design process. Using a browser-based crowd platform (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk), participants created electric “creature circuits” with LEDs in a virtual prototyping environment. We found that increasing the modularity of LED components (i) increased the quantity of prototypes created by study participants; and (ii) increased participants’ degree of perceived self-efficacy, self-reported creative feeling, and cognitive flow. The results highlight the importance of tool modularity in creative prototyping.",

Many existing accounts of deception imply that in order to act dishonestly one has to use cognitive control to overcome a bias toward the truth, which results in more time and effort. A recent hypothesis suggests that lying in order to serve self-interest may be a rapid, even automatic tendency taking less time than refraining from lying. In the current study, we track the action dynamics of potentially dishonest decisions to investigate the underlying cognitive processes. Participants are asked to privately predict the outcome of a virtual coin flip, report their accuracy and receive bonus credit for accurate predictions. The movements of the computer cursor toward the target answer are recorded and used to characterize the dynamics of decisions. Our results suggest that when a self-serving condition holds, decisions that have a high probability of being dishonest take less time and experience less hesitation.",

Conrad",Computers in Human Behavior,,February 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215301679,"Although 101-point feeling thermometer questions are frequently used in population surveys and political polls, the measurement error associated with this question type has raised some concerns. One challenge of using this type of question arises from the tendency for respondents to round their answers. That is, rather than providing a precise answer, respondents provide an answer that is divisible by 5 which on at least some occasions is rounded up or down from a more precise (unrounded) value. Several national surveys currently use an open-ended numeric text input format for the feeling thermometer questions, which may exacerbate the response rounding. This study presents findings from two Web survey experiments that examine six formats of 101-point rating scales. The findings show that visual analog scales (VAS) result in fewer rounded answers than open-ended numeric text input, while item nonresponse rates are similar across these questions types. Also, responding to VAS tends to be easier than open-ended format. This study concludes by discussing the application of VAS for feeling thermometer questions and future research directions.",

The current study examines the specific associations between age of first exposure, total CVE, and posttraumatic stress symptoms in adulthood. Further, the conditional and indirect effects of age of first exposure on posttraumatic stress symptoms were examined. We hypothesized that age of first exposure to violence would be associated with higher total violence exposure across childhood, thereby predicting current posttraumatic stress symptom severity (i.e., indirect effect). We also postulated that age of first exposure would affect the relationship between total violence exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms such that earlier exposure would exacerbate the effects of violence exposure (i.e., conditional effect). Participants included 269 violence-exposed adults recruited through MTurk; the mean age of first CVE was 6 years (SD = 3.29). Conditional process models indicated that age of first exposure was significantly associated with higher total childhood violence exposure, which in turn, was significantly associated with current posttraumatic stress symptoms in all domains. Further, a conditional effect of age of first exposure was present such that the relationship between total exposure to violence and symptoms of hyperarousal was stronger for those first exposed at earlier ages. Findings provide support suggesting the particular potency of early trauma on regulatory response systems.",

Varde, Jing Peng, Eileen Fitzpatrick",ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter,,June 2015,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2830548,"Much of the English in text documents today comes from nonnative speakers. Web searches are also conducted very often by non-native speakers. Though highly qualified in their respective fields, these speakers could potentially make errors in collocation, e.g., ""dark money"" and ""stock agora"" (instead of the more appropriate English expressions ""black money"" and ""stock market"" respectively). These may arise due to literal translation from the respective speaker's native language or other factors. Such errors could cause problems in contexts such as querying over Web pages, correct understanding of text documents and more. This paper proposes a framework called CollOrder to detect such collocation errors and suggest correctly ordered collocated responses for improving the semantics. This framework integrates machine learning approaches with natural language processing techniques, proposing suitable heuristics to provide responses to collocation errors, ranked in the order of correctness. We discuss the proposed framework with algorithms and experimental evaluation in this paper. We claim that it would be useful in semantically enhancing Web querying e.g., financial news, online shopping etc. It would also help in providing automated error correction in machine translated documents and offering assistance to people using ESL tools.",

This finding persists even when deferral does not provide more flexibility (Experiment 2), when deferral has potential disadvantages (Experiment 3), and when deferral has no material benefits and is financially costly (Experiment 4). The effect of importance on deferral was independent of potential choice conflict (Experiment 5 & 6). The only exception was a situation in which one alternative was clearly dominant; here decision importance did not affect the likelihood of deferral (Experiment 7).

McGugin; Ana Beth Van Gulick; Isabel Gauthier,Journal of Vision,,September 2015,http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2449199,"The Vanderbilt Expertise Test for cars (VETcar) is a test of visual learning for contemporary car models. We used item response theory to assess the VETcar and in particular used differential item functioning (DIF) analysis to ask if the test functions the same way in laboratory versus online settings and for different groups based on age and gender. An exploratory factor analysis found evidence of multidimensionality in the VETcar, although a single dimension was deemed sufficient to capture the recognition ability measured by the test. We selected a unidimensional three-parameter logistic item response model to examine item characteristics and subject abilities. The VETcar had satisfactory internal consistency. A substantial number of items showed DIF at a medium effect size for test setting and for age group, whereas gender DIF was negligible. Because online subjects were on average older than those tested in the lab, we focused on the age groups to conduct a multigroup item response theory analysis. This revealed that most items on the test favored the younger group. DIF could be more the rule than the exception when measuring performance with familiar object categories, therefore posing a challenge for the measurement of either domain-general visual abilities or category-specific knowledge.",

Jennings",arXiv,,September 2015,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.07599.pdf,"A recently introduced concept of cooperative equilibrium [7], based on the assumption that players have a natural attitude to cooperation, has been proven a powerful tool in predicting human behaviour in social dilemmas. In this paper, we extend this idea to more general game models, termed Pareto solvable games, which in particular include the Nash Bargaining Problem and the Ultimatum Game. We show that games in this class possess a unique pure cooperative equilibrium. Furthermore, for the Ultimatum Game, this notion appears to be strongly correlated with a suitably defined variant of the Dictator Game. We support this observation with the results of a behavioural experiment conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk, which demonstrates that our approach allows for making statistically precise predictions of average behaviour in such settings.",

These studies have operationalized addiction as either spending excessive amounts of time on social networking sites (SNS) or trouble controlling SNS use, but have not assessed the unique contribution of each of these constructs on outcomes in the same models. Moreover, these studies have exclusively been conducted with younger people rather than a heterogeneous sample. This study examined the independent relationship of a brief Facebook addiction scale, time spent on Facebook, and Facebook checking on positive and negative social domains, while controlling for self-esteem and social desirability. Methods: Participants were recruited using e-mail, SNS posts and through Amazon’s MTurk system. The sample included 489 respondents ages from 18 to approximately 70, who completed a 10–15 minute survey. Results: Results indicate that neither time spent on Facebook nor Facebook checking was significantly associated with either self-esteem, fear of negative social evaluation or social comparison, while SNS addiction symptoms were each independently associated with Facebook usage. Neither time spent on Facebook nor SNS addiction symptoms were associated with positive social relationships. Discussion: Overall results suggest that time on SNS and trouble controlling use should be considered independent constructs and that interventions should target underlying loss of control as the primary intervention target above ego syntonic time spent on the site.",

Revised probabilistic forecasts can be perceived by the public as indicative of such a trend. In five studies, we describe experts who make probabilistic forecasts of various natural events (effects of climate changes, landslide and earthquake risks) at two points in time. Prognoses that have been upgraded or downgraded from T1 to T2were in all studies expected to be updated further, in the same direction, later on (atT3). Thus, two prognoses were in these studies enough to define a trend, forming the basis for future projections. This “trend effect” implies that non-experts interpret recent forecast in light of what the expert said in the past, and think, for instance, that a “moderate” landslide risk will cause more worry if it has previously been low than if it has been high. By transcending the experts’ most recent forecasts the receivers are far from conservative, and appear to know more about the experts’ next prognoses than the experts themselves.",

Williams, Barbara Masser, Jessie Sun",Plos,,September 2015,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138886,"Recent research suggests that anthropomorphism can be harnessed as a tool to boost intentions to comply with social cause campaigns. Drawing on the human tendency to extend moral concern to entities portrayed as humanlike, it has been argued that adding personified features to a social campaign elevates anticipated guilt at failing to comply, and this subsequently boosts intentions to comply with that campaign. The present research aimed to extend extant research by disentangling the effects of emotional and non-emotional anthropomorphism, and differentiating amongst other emotional mechanisms of the anthropomorphism-compliance effect (namely, anticipated pride and anticipated regret). Experiment 1 (N = 294) compared the effectiveness of positive, negative, and emotionally-neutral anthropomorphized campaign posters for boosting campaign compliance intentions against non-anthropomorphized posters. We also measured potential mechanisms including anticipated guilt, regret, and pride. Results failed to support the anthropomorphism-compliance effect, and no changes in anticipated emotion according to anthropomorphism emerged. Experiments 2 (N = 150) and 3 (N = 196) represented further tests of the anthropomorphism-compliance effect. Despite high statistical power and efforts to closely replicate the conditions under which the anthropomorphism-compliance effect had been previously observed, no differences in compliance intention or anticipated emotion according to anthropomorphism emerged. A meta-analysis of the effects of anthropomorphism on compliance and anticipated emotion across the three experiments revealed effect size estimates that did not differ significantly from zero. The results of these three experiments suggest that the anthropomorphism-compliance effect is fragile and perhaps subject to contextual and idiographic influences. Thus, this research provides important insight and impetus for future research on the applied and theoretical utility of anthropomorphizing social cause campaigns.",

The current study investigated whether children use these two dimensions to structure their representations of familiar groups. Results indicated that adult warmth and competence judgments were independent from one another and placed groups in warmth by competence space in ways consistent with past work. However, children showed some sensitivity to both dimensions but did not treat them as independent. Children’s judgments of competence were closely aligned with adult judgments, but their judgments of warmth were influenced by factors that solely influenced adult judgments of competence. These data suggest that children develop an understanding of competence as an independent dimension prior to developing an understanding of warmth as an independent dimension and that their judgments of warmth may reflect a more general summing of all available evaluative information. Implications for children’s developing understanding of the broader intergroup landscape are discussed.",

Pizzi",Plos,,September 2015,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139193,"We examined the effects of incidental anger on perceived and actual polarization between Democrats and Republicans in the context of two national tragedies, Hurricane Katrina (Study 1) and the mass shooting that targeted Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona (Study 2). We hypothesized that because of its relevance to intergroup conflict, incidental anger exacerbates the political polarization effects of issue partisanship (the correlation between partisan identification and partisan attitudes), and, separately, the correlation between conservative partisan identification and perceived polarization between Democrats and Republicans. We further hypothesized that these effects would be strongest for Republican identification because Republican leaders were targets of public criticism in both tragedies and because conservative (Republican) ideology tends to be more sensitive to threat. In the studies, participants first completed an emotion induction procedure by recalling autobiographical events that made them angry (Studies 1 & 2), sad (Studies 1 & 2), or that involved recalling emotionally neutral events (Study 2). Participants later reported their attitudes regarding the two tragedies, their perceptions of the typical Democrat’s and Republican’s attitudes on those issues, and their identification with the Democratic and Republican parties. Compared with incidental sadness (Studies 1 and 2) and a neutral condition (Study 2), incidental anger exacerbated the associations between Republican identification and partisan attitudes, and, separately between Republican identification and perceived polarization between the attitudes of Democrats and Republicans. We discuss implications for anger’s influence on political attitude formation and perceptions of group differences in political attitudes.",

Social facilitation theory states that the real, imagined, or implied presence of other social agents can improve cognitive performance. Typically these agents are other humans, but the current study explores the possibility that robots can trigger social facilitation effects. We hypothesized that more humanlike social stimuli are (1) more likely to be ascribed internal states (e.g., having a mind, having emotions, having preferences), and (2) more likely to induce social facilitation on a vigilance task. Experiment 1 investigates the relationship between physical humanness and attributions of intentionality by comparing ratings of internal states for three agents (human, robot, and nonsocial). In Experiment 2, we examine whether physical humanness results in improved performance on a vigilance task through social facilitation. While Experiment 1 showed the expected positive relationship between human appearance and mind attribution, the degree to which mental states were attributed to an agent did not influence performance on the vigilance task. The implications for social robotics are discussed.",

According to research on terror management theory, reminding people of their own death strengthens worldview-bolstering reactions, such as following cultural standards and supporting people who uphold those standards. Assuming Snowden’s disclosures were motivated by fighting for the truth and for the value of honesty, and further that cultural values become more important under mortality salience, we hypothesized that reminding people on their own death increases heroic perceptions of Snowden. As predicted, results of our study indicated that participants in the mortality salience condition reported stronger heroic perceptions compared to a control group. This effect was found to be independent of patriotism or political orientation.",

This preference arises from the perception that items with earlier serial numbers are temporally closer to the origin (e.g., the designer or artist who produced it). In turn, beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects may acquire a special essence from their past) lead consumers to view these items as possessing more of a valued essence. Using an archival data set and five lab experiments, the authors find the preference for items with earlier serial numbers holds across multiple consumer domains including recorded music, art, and apparel. Further, this preference appears to be independent from inferences about the quality of the item, salience of the number, or beliefs about market value. Finally, when serial numbers no longer reflect beliefs about proximity to the origin, the preference for items with earlier serial numbers is attenuated. The authors conclude by demonstrating boundary conditions of this preference in the context of common marketing practices.",

These models discover semantically coherent combinations of words (topics) that could be integrated in a clinical automatic summarization system for primary care physicians performing chart review. However, the human interpretability of topics discovered from clinical reports is unknown. Our objective is to assess the coherence of topics and their ability to represent the contents of clinical reports from a primary care physician's point of view. Methods: Three latent Dirichlet allocation models (50 topics, 100 topics, and 150 topics) were fit to a large collection of clinical reports. Topics were manually evaluated by primary care physicians and graduate students. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests for Paired Samples were used to evaluate differences between different topic models, while differences in performance between students and primary care physicians (PCPs) were tested using Mann–Whitney U tests for each of the tasks. Results: While the 150-topic model produced the best log likelihood, participants were most accurate at identifying words that did not belong in topics learned by the 100-topic model, suggesting that 100 topics provides better relative granularity of discovered semantic themes for the data set used in this study. Models were comparable in their ability to represent the contents of documents. Primary care physicians significantly outperformed students in both tasks. Conclusion: This work establishes a baseline of interpretability for topic models trained with clinical reports, and provides insights on the appropriateness of using topic models for informatics applications. Our results indicate that PCPs find discovered topics more coherent and representative of clinical reports relative to students, warranting further research into their use for automatic summarization.",
,,,,534,Two different approaches to the affective profiles model: median splits (variable-oriented) and cluster analysis (person-oriented),"Danilo Garcia, Shane MacDonald, Trevor Archer",PeerJ,,October 2015,https://peerj.com/articles/1380/,"Background. The notion of the affective system as being composed of two dimensions led Archer and colleagues to the development of the affective profiles model. The model consists of four different profiles based on combinations of individuals’ experience of high/low positive and negative affect: self-fulfilling, low affective, high affective, and self-destructive. During the past 10 years, an increasing number of studies have used this person-centered model as the backdrop for the investigation of between and within individual differences in ill-being and well-being. The most common approach to this profiling is by dividing individuals’ scores of self-reported affect using the median of the population as reference for high/low splits. However, scores just-above and just-below the median might become high and low by arbitrariness, not by reality. Thus, it is plausible to criticize the validity of this variable-oriented approach. Our aim was to compare the median splits approach with a person-oriented approach, namely, cluster analysis. Method. The participants (N = 2, 225) were recruited through Amazons’ Mechanical Turk and asked to self-report affect using the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule. We compared the profiles’ homogeneity and Silhouette coefficients to discern differences in homogeneity and heterogeneity between approaches. We also conducted exact cell-wise analyses matching the profiles from both approaches and matching profiles and gender to investigate profiling agreement with respect to affectivity levels and affectivity and gender. All analyses were conducted using the ROPstat software. Results. The cluster approach (weighted average of cluster homogeneity coefficients = 0.62, Silhouette coefficients = 0.68) generated profiles with greater homogeneity and more distinctive from each other compared to the median splits approach (weighted average of cluster homogeneity coefficients = 0.75, Silhouette coefficients = 0.59). Most of the participants (n = 1,736, 78.0%) were allocated to the same profile (Rand Index = .83), however, 489 (21.98%) were allocated to different profiles depending on the approach. Both approaches allocated females and males similarly in three of the four profiles. Only the cluster analysis approach classified men significantly more often than chance to a self-fulfilling profile (type) and females less often than chance to this very same profile (antitype). Conclusions. Although the question whether one approach is more appropriate than the other is still without answer, the cluster method allocated individuals to profiles that are more in accordance with the conceptual basis of the model and also to expected gender differences. More importantly, regardless of the approach, our findings suggest that the model mirrors a complex and dynamic adaptive system.",

Yet, there has been considerably less investigation into whether people perceive the electorate to be polarized and the patterns of these perceptions. Building on work in social psychology, we argue that Americans perceive more polarization with respect to policy issues than actually exists, a phenomenon known as false polarization. Data from a nationally representative probability sample and a novel estimation strategy to make inferences about false polarization show that people significantly misperceive the public to be more divided along partisan lines than it is in reality. Also, people’s misperceptions of opposing partisans are larger than those about their own party. We discuss the implications of these empirical patterns for American electoral politics.",

Seventy-four participants were shown pictures of two agents (human and robot) and storytelling narratives, which they had to complete.

Half of the participants were given stories using the perspective of the agent (perspective taking condition) and the other half was given stories using a third-person perspective (non-perspective taking condition). It was hypothesized that participants in the perspective taking condition would rate the agent higher on human-likeness and trust compared to the non-perspective taking condition. Interestingly, the results support our hypothesis for human-likeness but not for trust. The findings have important implications for the design of social robots by demonstrating the importance of perspective taking exercises on perception of humanness. Future studies need to validate the effects of perspective taking on human-robot interaction in various contexts and with different robot agents.",

Traditional telepresence systems allow remote users to passively observe, forcing them to look at whatever the camera is pointing at. If we want something to remain private, then we simply do not put it in front of the camera. Remote presence systems, on the other hand, allow active observation, and put the control of the camera in the hands of the remote operator. They can drive around, and look at the world from different viewpoints, which complicates privacy protection. In this paper, we look at how we can establish privacy protections for remote presence systems by manipulating the video data sent back to them. We evaluate a number of manipulations of these data, balancing privacy protection against the ability to perform a given task, and report on the results of two studies that attempt to evaluate these techniques.",

Furthermore, we explored whether parental mediation was associated with child delinquency. Our results demonstrate that active mediation is generally negative or neutral in nature. Involved parents were more likely to use each mediation strategy than less involved parents; however, parental involvement did not predict negative mediation. Restrictive and negative mediation were significantly related to child delinquency. In sum, the findings show that parents are involved in monitoring their children’s use of this medium, just as they are with television.",

Although older adults reported a more limited future time perspective than younger adults, age and a limited future time perspective had opposite effects in predicting subjective well-being, affect, positive emotions, empathy, and attitudes toward emotions. That is, old age was linked to a more adaptive emotional profile, whereas a limited future time perspective was linked to a more maladaptive emotional profile. This was the case even after controlling for health-related aspects. The findings question the usage of future time perspective as an explanatory variable for observed age differences in emotional functioning.",

Silver sputtered slides coated with APTES were immersed in NaOH solution, enabling us to produce silver surfaces homogeneously covered with APTES. The surface properties of grafted APTES on sputtered silver surface as a occasion of time were studied using SPR analysis, AFM and contact angle measurement. The mechanical and chemical stability of samples was assayed by tape test and NaCl test. The answers show that hydrolysis and condensation of APTES are activated in alkaline solution and lead to formation of a protective APTES layer on the surface of silver. The morphology of APTES on silver surface is a function of coverage density that is altered by changing time. At short times (< 30 min), APTES molecules physically adsorb to the surface leads to weak protection. At higher condensation times, APTES molecules chemically bond to the surface and each other leads to better protection.",

Retrospective harmonization where different studies lack common measures of comparable constructs presents a major challenge. This study compared different approaches to harmonization with a crosswalk sample who completed multiple versions of the measures to be harmonized. Methods: Through online recruitment, 1061 participants aged 30 to 98 answered two different depression scales, and 1065 participants answered multiple measures of subjective health. Rational and configural methods of harmonization were applied, using the crosswalk sample to determine their success; and empirical item response theory (IRT) methods were applied in order empirically to compare items from different measures as answered by the same person. Results: For depression, IRT worked well to provide a conversion table between different measures. The rational method of extracting semantically matched items from each of the two scales proved an acceptable alternative to IRT. For subjective health, only configural harmonization was supported. The subjective health items used in most studies form a single robust factor. Conclusion: Caution is required in aging research when pooling data across studies using different measures of the same construct. Of special concern are response scales that vary widely in the number of response options, especially if the anchors are asymmetrical. A crosswalk sample that has completed items from each of the measures being harmonized allows the investigator to use empirical approaches to identify flawed assumptions in rational or configural approaches to harmonizing.",

Schmidt",Evolutionary Psychology,,November 2015,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1474704915613915,"What is the function of emotional tearing? Previous work has found a tear effect, which resolves ambiguity in neutral expressions and increases perceptions of sadness in sad expressions. Tearing, however, is associated with a variety of emotional states, and it remains unclear how the tear effect generalizes to other emotion expressions. Here we expand upon previous works by examining ratings of video clips depicting posed facial expressions presented with and without tears. We replicate Provine et al.’s (2009) findings that tearing increases perceptions of sadness in sad expressions. Furthermore, we find that tearing has specific effects on ratings of emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear) and ratings of intensity and valence in neutral, positive, and negative expressions. These results suggest that tearing may serve a specific and independent communicative function, interacting with those of various expressions.",

However, little research has been conducted on the immediate effects of guided activities they are composed of, or how these might differ dependent on the type of reminiscence. The current study utilised a controlled experimental design, whereby 321 young adults (mean age = 25.5 years, SD = 3.0) were randomised to one of four conditions of online reminiscence activity: problem-solving (successful coping experiences), identity (self-defining events contributing to a meaningful and continuous personal identity), bitterness revival (negative or adverse events), or a control condition (any memory from their past). Participants recalled autobiographical memories congruent with the condition, and answered questions to facilitate reflection on the memories. The results indicated that problem-solving and identity reminiscence activities caused significant improvements in self-esteem, meaning in life, self-efficacy and affect, whereas no effects were found in the bitterness revival and control conditions. Problem-solving reminiscence also caused a small effect in increasing perceptions of a life narrative/s. Differences between the conditions did not appear to be explained by the positive-valence of memories. These results provide evidence for the specific effects of adaptive types of problem-solving and identity reminiscence in young adults.",

The present study examined the impact of perceived pubertal timing on symptoms of anxiety and depression in two distinct psychosocial contexts: parent’s perceptions of their own harsh parenting and parent’s perceptions of their child’s peer problems. The sample consisted of 412 parents (M = 38.6 years old, SD = 7.8, 60.4 % mothers) of children between the ages of 8 and 17 (M = 12.13, SD = 2.97, 45.4 % girls). All constructs were assessed by parent reports. Linear multiple regression analyses revealed that the interaction between earlier pubertal timing and greater peer problems was significantly related to higher youth depressive and anxiety symptoms. The interaction between earlier pubertal timing and greater harsh discipline was significantly related to higher youth anxiety but not depressive symptoms. Youth gender did not qualify findings. Results suggest that the contextual amplification process of early pubertal timing may occur in both high stress family and peer environments and impact both girls and boys.",

Such persistent preconceptions are based on arguments referring to increased variation, the limits of certain software and technologies, and a noteworthy lack of comparisons (between Web and lab) in fully randomized experiments. To provide a critical test, participants were randomly assigned to complete a lexical decision task either (a) in the lab using standard experimental software (E-Prime), (b) in the lab using a browser-based version (written in HTML and JavaScript), or (c) via the Web using the same browser-based version. The classical word frequency effect was typical in size and corresponded to a very large effect in all three conditions. There was no indication that the Web- or browser-based data collection was in any way inferior. In fact, if anything, a larger effect was obtained in the browser-based conditions than in the condition relying on standard experimental software. No differences between Web and lab (within the browser-based conditions) could be observed, thus disconfirming any substantial influence of increased technical or situational variation. In summary, the present experiment contradicts the still common preconception that reaction time effects of only a few hundred milliseconds cannot be detected in Web experiments.",

Epstein",Journal of Neuroscience,,November 2015,http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/44/14896.short,"The use of landmarks is central to many navigational strategies. Here we use multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to understand how landmarks are coded in the human brain. Subjects were scanned while viewing the interiors and exteriors of campus buildings. Despite their visual dissimilarity, interiors and exteriors corresponding to the same building elicited similar activity patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial complex (RSC), and occipital place area (OPA), three regions known to respond strongly to scenes and buildings. Generalization across stimuli depended on knowing the correspondences among them in the PPA but not in the other two regions, suggesting that the PPA is the key region involved in learning the different perceptual instantiations of a landmark. In contrast, generalization depended on the ability to freely retrieve information from memory in RSC, and it did not depend on familiarity or cognitive task in OPA. Together, these results suggest a tripartite division of labor, whereby PPA codes landmark identity, RSC retrieves spatial or conceptual information associated with landmarks, and OPA processes visual features that are important for landmark recognition.",

Yet, perhaps surprisingly, there is still little consensus on how generally the phenomenon holds, how best to aggregate crowd judgements, and how social influence affects estimates. We investigate these questions by taking a meta wisdom of crowds approach. With a distributed team of over 100 student researchers across 17 institutions in the United States and India, we develop a large-scale online experiment to systematically study the wisdom of crowds effect for 1,000 different tasks in 50 subject domains. These tasks involve various types of knowledge (e.g., explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, and prediction), question formats (e.g., multiple choice and point estimation), and inputs (e.g., text, audio, and video). To examine the effect of social influence, participants are randomly assigned to one of three different experiment conditions in which they see varying degrees of information on the responses of others. In this ongoing project, we are now preparing to recruit participants via Amazon?s Mechanical Turk.",

Six faculty experts (FEs) and 203 Amazon.com Mechanical Turk crowd workers (CWs) evaluated 21 deidentified video clips using the Global Objective Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills validated rating instrument. Results: Within 19 hours and 15 minutes we received 662 eligible ratings from 203 CWs and 126 ratings from 6 FEs over 10 days. FE video ratings were of borderline internal consistency (Krippendorff’s alpha = .55). FE ratings were highly correlated with CW ratings (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = .78, P < .001). Conclusion: We propose the use of Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical Skills as a reliable, basic tool to standardize the evaluation of technical skills in general surgery.",

Across five laboratory experiments, we explored occasions when people naturally experience enhanced motivation to take actions that facilitate goal pursuit and why certain dates are more likely to spur goal initiation than others. We present causal evidence that emphasizing a temporal landmark denoting the beginning of a new time period increases people's intentions to initiate goal pursuit. In addition, we propose and show that people's strengthened motivation to begin pursuing their aspirations following such temporal landmarks originates in part from the psychological disassociation these landmarks induce from a person's past, imperfect self.",

We present a neural network to learn document-level representation. In our model, we not only learn to represent each sentence but also represent the whole document of the review. We apply traditional convolutional neural network to represent the semantic meaning of sentences. We present two variant convolutional neural-network models to learn the document representation. The model taking sentence importance into consideration shows the better performance in deceptive spam detection which enhances the value of F1 by 5 %.",

Four studies tested two motivations related to social belonging: belonging needs and racial identification. Greater need to belong and racial identification (Study 1), and two types of social belonging threats—social exclusion (Studies 2a and 2b) and racial identity threat (Study 3)—predicted more categorizations of racially ambiguous Black/White faces as Black, with White participants more likely to categorize ambiguous faces as outgroup members (i.e., Black; Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3) and Black participants more likely to categorize ambiguous faces as ingroup members (Study 2b). Results also demonstrated that self-affirmation mitigated this motivated categorization for Whites (Study 3), illustrating the malleability of social categorization and its dependency on serving self-relevant goals.",

Inherent in the challenge of Big Data is that it often exceeds a scale at which humans can effectively operate. In this paper, we focus on the domain of archived newspaper articles, and describe a system that generates a collection of event summaries from unstructured text, extracts a geographic marker for the event, and stores both in an on-line database that can be searched and/or visualized using an interactive map. The system relies on text mining techniques to filter out a dataset of news stories from a digital news archive source and extracts 1-2 sentences from each event to be stored in the database. We illustrate this approach using a flood database case study, automatically extracting descriptions of past flooding events occurring in Nova Scotia, Canada from a 20-year archive of regional newspaper articles. We validate our event extraction in two dimensions (identification of articles mentioning flood events; identification of accurate geographic markers from articles about flood events) using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to obtain human assessments at scale.",

We employed three large samples (Ns = 268, 527, 292) to examine concurrent and prospective associations between struggles with r/s doubt and anxiety over three time frames: 2 weeks, 1 month, and 1 year. Analyses revealed that (a) each construct exhibited high cross-temporal stability; (b) there were moderate, positive concurrent associations between anxiety and doubt-related struggles; (c) anxiety predicted increases in doubt-related struggles over each time frame; and (d) there was mixed evidence regarding whether doubt-related struggles predicted changes in anxiety over time.

To date, however, little research has examined the importance of a specific set of self-efficacy sources after fully accounting for the influence of other sources. Data were obtained from 278 adult trainees who completed online Microsoft Excel training. Results suggest that once accounting for achievement goal orientation, Bandura's sources of vicarious experience and negative emotional arousal are still important contributors to pretraining self-efficacy beliefs. As such, organizations seeking to maximize training effectiveness may wish to consider pretraining interventions simultaneously targeting achievement goal orientation, vicarious experience and negative emotional arousal.",

In the current research, structural stigma is proposed as a moderating variable that strengthens deleterious associations between perceived discrimination and social relationship functioning. Hypotheses were tested in two cross-sectional studies, including both online (N = 214; Study 1) and community (N = 94; Study 2) samples of sexual minority men and women residing throughout the United States. Structural stigma was coded from policy related to sexual minority rights within each state. Confirming hypotheses, support for the moderating role of structural stigma was found via multilevel models across studies. Specifically, associations between perceived discrimination and friendship strain, loneliness (Study 1) and familial strain (Study 2) were increased for those who resided in states with greater levels of structural stigma and attenuated for those who resided in states with lesser levels. In Study 1, these results were robust to state-level covariates (conservatism and religiosity), but conservatism emerged as a significant moderator in lieu of structural stigma in Study 2. Results are discussed in the context of the shifting landscape of public policy related to sexual minority rights within the United States.",

There is concern that NIPS could lead to more negative attitudes towards Down syndrome and less support for individuals with Down syndrome. To assess the impact of NIPS on support for prenatal testing, decision-making about testing, and beliefs or attitudes about Down syndrome, we performed an Internet-based experiment using adults (N = 1,789) recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were randomly assigned to read a mock news article about NIPS, a mock news article about amniocentesis, or no article. The content in the two articles varied only in their descriptions of the test characteristics. Participants then answered questions about their support for testing, hypothetical testing decision, and beliefs and attitudes about Down syndrome. Reading the mock NIPS news article predicted increased hypothetical test uptake. In addition, the NIPS article group also agreed more strongly that pregnant women, in general, should utilize prenatal testing. We also found that the more strongly participants supported prenatal testing for pregnant women, the less favorable their attitudes towards individuals with Down syndrome; providing some evidence that NIPS may indirectly result in more negative perceptions of individuals with this diagnosis.",

We investigated this issue in the current study. In Studies 1 and 2 we assessed the factor structure of the CSE factor after controlling for common method variance, which is a salient threat to the validity of higher-order constructs. We found that locus of control no longer loaded on CSE when we controlled for social desirability (Study 1) and when the traits were measured at different times (Study 2). To directly test whether locus of control is better suited as a core evaluation of the environment, in Study 3 we primed 110 employees to think about the predictability of their work environment. Results of this experiment revealed that ratings of locus of control changed as a function of the environment-based manipulation, whereas ratings of the other traits did not.

However, images captured using typical real-world mobile camera devices are usually afflicted by complex mixtures of multiple distortions, which are not necessarily well-modeled by the synthetic distortions found in existing databases. The originators of existing legacy databases usually conducted human psychometric studies to obtain statistically meaningful sets of human opinion scores on images in a stringently controlled visual environment, resulting in small data collections relative to other kinds of image analysis databases. Towards overcoming these limitations, we designed and created a new database that we call the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database, which contains widely diverse authentic image distortions on a large number of images captured using a representative variety of modern mobile devices. We also designed and implemented a new online crowdsourcing system, which we have used to conduct a very large-scale, multi-month image quality assessment subjective study. Our database consists of over 350,000 opinion scores on 1,162 images evaluated by over 8100 unique human observers. Despite the lack of control over the experimental environments of the numerous study participants, we demonstrate excellent internal consistency of the subjective dataset. We also evaluate several top-performing blind IQA algorithms on it and present insights on how mixtures of distortions challenge both end users as well as automatic perceptual quality prediction models",

In particular, we track people in videos and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to represent the track features. We learn time-varying attention weights to combine these features at each time-instant. The attended features are then processed using another RNN for event detection/classification. Since most video datasets with multiple people are restricted to a small number of videos, we also collected a new basketball dataset comprising 257 basketball games with 14K event annotations corresponding to 11 event classes. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both event classification and detection on this new dataset.

In contrast, we formulate hypotheses based on the different findings in these studies and, instead of verifying them based on user feedback, we compare them directly on data from a commercial crowdsourcing platform. For evaluation, we use a Bayesian approach called HypTrails which allows us to give a relative ranking of the corresponding hypotheses. The hypotheses considered, are for example based on task categories, monetary incentives or semantic similarity of task descriptions. We find that, in our scenario, hypotheses based on employers as well the the task descriptions work best.Overall, we objectively compare different factors influencing users when choosing their tasks.

Initial responses and changes in responses after accessing the information were analyzed from Likert scores of 242 participants and from their written comments. Participants were less willing to accept the use of gestation stalls after viewing information on sow housing. For example, initially 30.4% of respondents indicated that they supported the use of gestation stalls; this declined to 17.8% after participants were provided additional information. Qualitative analysis of comments showed that supporters of gestation stalls expressed concern about the spread of disease and aggression between animals in less confined systems, whereas supporters of group housing placed more emphasis on the sow’s ability to interact socially and perform natural behaviors. These results point to public opposition to the use of gestation stalls, and indicate that the more that the public learns about gestation stalls the less willing they will be to accept their use.",

The event detection method is based on Fuzzy Fingerprint, which is a supervised method trained on documents with annotated event tags. To cope with the possible usage of different terms to describe the same event, we explore distributed representations of text in the form of word embeddings, which contributed to improve the summarization results. The proposed summarization methods are based on the hierarchical combination of single-document summaries.

For example, the interpretation of quantifiers requires listeners to determine the relevant domain and scale. We focus on another type of context-dependence that quantifiers share with other lexical items: talker variability. Different talkers might use quantifiers with different interpretations in mind. We used a web-based crowdsourcing paradigm to study participants’ expectations about the use of many and some based on recent exposure. We first established that the mapping of some and many onto quantities (candies in a bowl) is variable both within and between participants. We then examined whether and how listeners’ expectations about quantifier use adapts with exposure to talkers who use quantifiers in different ways. The results demonstrate that listeners can adapt to talker-specific biases in both how often and with what intended meaning many and some are used.",

It also examined whether people's agreement with the content of the comments would influence the TPP. Results of an experiment (N = 301) showed incivility muted the persuasive effect of online comments, so only civil comments produced a TPP, whereby people felt comments had greater persuasive power over others compared with themselves. However, counter to predictions, whether people agreed with the comments did not influence the TPP. Findings also supported the TPP social distance corollary such that subjects perceived comments as having the largest third-person perceptual gap between the self and those who disagreed with them. Results are discussed in relation to TPP and face and politeness theories.",

Furthermore, it is important to investigate etiological factors that may be associated with these disparities, such as self-reported discrimination. The current work tested whether sexual minority adults in the United States reported less positive social health (i.e., loneliness, friendship strain, familial strain, and social capital) relative to heterosexuals and whether self-reported discrimination accounted for these disparities. Participants for the current study (N = 579) were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, including 365 self-identified heterosexuals (105 women) and 214 sexual minorities (103 women). Consistent with hypotheses, sexual minorities reported impaired social health relative to heterosexuals, with divergent patterns emerging by sexual orientation subgroup (which were generally consistent across sexes). Additionally, self-reported discrimination accounted for disparities across three of four indicators of social health. These findings suggest that sexual minorities may face obstacles related to prejudice and discrimination that impair the functioning of their relationships and overall social health. Moreover, because social health is closely related to psychological and physical health, remediating disparities in social relationships may be necessary to address other health disparities based upon sexual orientation. Expanding upon these results, implications for efforts to build resilience among sexual minorities are discussed.",

Veilleux",Eating Behaviors,,January 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015315300192,"Action orientation, or the ability to regulate both positive and negative affect to perform goal-directed action, has been associated with eating behavior in previous research. Additionally, differences in beliefs about self-control have been shown to influence behavior, but it is unclear how these beliefs impact disordered eating behavior or how they may interact with other self-regulatory mechanisms to predict eating outcomes. In this study, 1128 participants were recruited online via Amazon Mechanical Turk to answer questions about self-regulation constructs and eating behavior. A three-way moderated regression analysis was used to assess relationships between two subtypes of action orientation (failure-related action orientation, or AOF, which describes an ability to up-regulate positive affect, and decision-related action orientation, or AOD, which describes an ability to down-regulate negative affect), willpower beliefs, and binge eating. Results revealed a significant three-way interaction between AOD, AOF, and willpower beliefs such that the interaction between AOF and willpower beliefs was only significant for those with low AOD. These findings suggest an ability to down-regulate negative affect (high AOF) is a protective factor against increased disordered eating, though this may not be the case for individuals with an inability to up-regulate positive affect (low AOD) and simultaneously ascribe to beliefs that willpower is a limited resource.",

Ostracism induces both prosocial behaviors (moving toward) and antisocial behaviors (moving against). One reason that moving away may be missing from these observed responses is the absence of including such a response in experiments. In four studies, we examined whether ostracized individuals would avail themselves of a moving away response (i.e., seeking solitude), if offered, and also whether one individual difference—introversion—predicted higher desires to move away. Correlational data (Study 1) showed that participants who reported more ostracism experiences indicated stronger desires to be alone; three experiments (Studies 2–4) demonstrated that manipulated ostracism experience increases the desire to be alone in a subsequent activity, especially among introverts. These findings suggest that ostracized individuals may desire a phase of solitude to cope with the social pain.",

Using quantitative and qualitative analyses, we found WhatsApp to unlock new opportunities for intimate communications, Facebook to be characterized by primarily non-social uses, and both media to be powerful lifelogging tools. Unsatisfying experiences were primarily rooted in the tools' breach of offline social norms, as well in content fatigue and exposure to undesirable content in the case of Facebook. We discuss the implications of the findings for the design of social media.",

While this domain has invited numerous research, but research highlighting how consumers react toward learning the size of a firm conducting CSR and geographical scope of the CSR impact is still scarce. We investigate how consumers shape their attitude and consumption behavior after knowing that the CSR action is done by a small, locally-owned business that brings impact to the local community through an experimental study. Our study adds a shade in understanding how the effect of a firm size and geographical scope of CSR impact might increase consumers' favorable attitude and behavior toward the business and its products. Our findings show that when consumers learn that the firm conducting CSR is a small, locally-owned (in coffee shop business) that directs its action toward local beneficiaries, they demonstrate more favorable attitudes toward the action and the firm, which manifest in the form of better intentions to acquire the product as well as willingness to pay premium prices for it. Our findings confirm the US consumers' love affair with local businesses, in particular. While the findings generally benefit small, locally-owned businesses, they also suggest recommendations for large, multinational businesses to design their marketing strategy in an attempt to increase favorable reactions from consumers.",

Gray, Siddharth Suri",Policy & Internet,,November 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/poi3.111/full,"Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online labor market that defines itself as “a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence.” Early advocates and developers of crowdsourcing platforms argued that crowdsourcing tasks are designed so people of any skill level can do this labor online. However, as the popularity of crowdsourcing work has grown, the crowdsourcing literature has identified a peculiar issue: that work quality of workers is not responsive to changes in price. This means that unlike what economic theory would predict, paying crowdworkers higher wages does not lead to higher quality work. This has led some to believe that platforms, like AMT, attract poor quality workers. This article examines different market dynamics that might, unwittingly, contribute to the inefficiencies in the market that generate poor work quality. We argue that the cultural logics and socioeconomic values embedded in AMT's platform design generate a greater amount of market power for requesters (those posting tasks) than for individuals doing tasks for pay (crowdworkers). We attribute the uneven distribution of market power among participants to labor market frictions, primarily characterized by uncompetitive wage posting and incomplete information. Finally, recommendations are made for how to tackle these frictions when contemplating the design of an online labor market.",

In the present paper, we examined the factor structure of this scale using data pooled from six independent samples (Ntotal = 938). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the Valuing Happiness Scale is not unidimensional and that only one of its three factors correlates negatively with various indicators of well-being, whereas non-significant or positive correlations were found for the other factors. These findings indicate that valuing happiness may not necessarily be bad for one’s well-being, and call for a better definition, theoretical foundation, and operationalization of this construct.",

But language also provides a strong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models truly understanding the visual content. This can hinder progress in pushing state of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal AI. In this paper, we address binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on abstract scenes. We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts inquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple that concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If the concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is “yes”, and otherwise “no”. Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on the highlevel semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level recognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the modality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and the role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs of scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is “yes” for one scene, and “no” for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language priors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset. Moreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art VQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced dataset.",

Cottrell",arXiv,,January 2016,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04103.pdf,"Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in the computer vision field, especially for visual object recognition tasks. The features useful for object classification are learned by feed-forward deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically, and they are shown to be able to predict and decode neural representations in the ventral visual pathway of humans and monkeys. However, despite the huge amount of work on optimizing CNNs, there has not been much research focused on linking CNNs with guiding principles from the human visual cortex. In this work, we propose a network optimization strategy inspired by both of the developmental trajectory of children’s visual object recognition capabilities, and Bar (2003), who hypothesized that basic level information is carried in the fast magnocellular pathway through the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and then projected back to inferior temporal cortex (IT), where subordinate level categorization is achieved. We instantiate this idea by training a deep CNN to perform basic level object categorization first, and then train it on subordinate level categorization. We apply this idea to training AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) on the ILSVRC 2012 dataset and show that the top-5 accuracy increases from 80.13% to 82.14%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. We also show that subsequent transfer learning on smaller datasets gives superior results.",

In this study, we examine how the Big Five personality traits moderate the effects of presenting a justification for social media monitoring on feelings of invasiveness and unfairness. Findings from an experiment conducted with 195 participants suggest that the presence of a justification for monitoring lowered perceptions of invasiveness, and invasiveness fully mediated the effect of presenting a justification on fairness perceptions. However, these findings were dependent on agreeableness and openness; people with high agreeableness and low openness were easily placated with justifications for social media monitoring, whereas people with low agreeableness and high openness were not moved by justifications. These results demonstrate the importance of individual differences to understanding when people will resist or accept organizational efforts to pry into their online activities.",

Additionally, we provide new evidence that the SINS may not primarily tap into grandiose narcissism. We also find that in comparison to other common personality measures of narcissism, the SINS correlated somewhat less consistently with our behavioral measure and has a higher threshold for detecting narcissistic traits. Overall, we conclude that when inclusion of established measures is not feasible, the SINS may be a viable alternative.",

Here we test this in linked analyses addressing the structure of Grit and its fit within broader personality and intelligence constructs. An initial Structural Equation Model (SEM) in 494 subjects (age 18–69 years) confirmed a two-factor structure of the Grit scales. Tests adding facet-level assessments of conscientiousness (C) and neuroticism (N) indicated that while grit consistency fit well under C, grit perseverance and related measures of control defined an “effortful persistence” construct which could not be reduced to effects of C and/or N. While conscientiousness and IQ adequately accounted for school grades, higher perseverance was associated with higher life-course accomplishment. The work supports three factors of central relevance to achievement: IQ, conscientiousness, and effortful persistence, each with distinct mechanisms.",

In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically recognize the concept of a vocal imitation, and then retrieve sounds of this concept. Because different acoustic aspects (e.g., pitch, loudness, timbre) are emphasized in imitating different sounds, a key challenge in vocal imitation recognition is to extract appropriate features. Hand-crafted features may not work well for a large variety of imitations. Instead, we use a stacked auto-encoder to automatically learn features from a set of vocal imitations in an unsupervised way. Then, a multi-class SVM is trained for sound concepts of interest using their training imitations. Given a new vocal imitation of a sound concept of interest, our system can recognize its underlying concept and return it with a high rank among all concepts. Experiments show that our system significantly outperforms an MFCC-based comparison system in both classification and retrieval.",

This experiment manipulated the alleged crime (violent, child, or sexual assault) and the defendant’s physical appearance (good, mediocre, or bad). Following Savage (1954), uncertainty about the guilt of the defendant was conceptualized in terms of prospective jurors’ willingness to gamble about whether the defendant is guilty. For each case, participants were asked to choose between a standard lottery, with specified probability of winning $100 versus nothing, and a trial gamble involving the unspecified probability of guilt (win $100) and innocence (win nothing) for the case presented. Participants indicated a preference to either play the standard lottery or the trial gamble, or indifference between the two options. Once a participant indicated indifference, the probability of guilt was set equal to the probability of winning the standard lottery. Across all 3 types of crimes and all 3 categories of appearance, median participants’ prior odds of guilt were close to 0.50, indicating that prospective jurors generally believed the defendants were just as likely to be guilty as innocent prior to the introduction of any evidence. A main effect for appearance was detected. ‘Bad’ and ‘mediocre’ defendants were perceived to be more likely to be guilty than ‘good’ defendants. There were no differences between the various alleged crimes. Overall, male participants and self-identified Republicans were the most likely to have high (>0.65) prior probabilities of guilt. Implications for legal doctrine are discussed.",

White individuals primed with SLBs perceived greater anti-White bias, endorsed greater zero-sum beliefs, and indicated less support for Affirmative Action than individuals primed with neutral content. Mediation analysis revealed that the SLB prime decreased support for Affirmative Action by increasing perceptions of anti-White bias.

One domain in which narcissism may have particularly interesting effects is individuals’ spirituality. When interpersonal expectations have been violated, individuals experience a variety of emotions. Chief among these emotions is guilt, which is linked both thematically and empirically to many aspects of Western religion. Given narcissism’s complex relationship with guilt, it is important to investigate how narcissists may react to failings in the interpersonal domain, particularly in a spiritual context. The current study investigated the effects of a simulated interpersonal failing on narcissists’ interest in a variety of spiritual behaviors, including prayer, seeking spiritual guidance, and participating in spiritual activities aimed at self-enhancement. After reading a scenario designed to induce feelings associated with interpersonal failings, participants reported their interest in a variety of religious activities, including prayer. Results indicated that the manipulation tended to decrease interest in a variety of spiritual activities across the sample, but that these effects were only robust among participants high in narcissism.",

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether morality is consistent across many occasions of everyday life, implying that personological factors play an important role in moral behavior. A novel method of assessing moral behaviors was developed and employed in two experience sampling studies (4075 total observations). Results showed that moral behavior is consistent in many different ways, suggesting that personological factors substantially impact moral life.",

We sought to compare assessment of technical performance obtained from the crowdsourcers with that of surgical content experts (CE). Our hypothesis is that the crowd can score performances of renal hilar dissection comparably to surgical CE using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS). METHODS: A group of resident and attending robotic surgeons submitted a total of 14 video clips of RPN during hilar dissection. These videos were rated by both crowd and CE for technical skills performance using GEARS. A minimum of 3 CE and 30 Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers evaluated each video with the GEARS scale. RESULTS: Within 13 days, we received ratings of all videos from all CE, and within 11.5 hours, we received 548 GEARS ratings from crowdworkers. Even though CE were exposed to a training module, internal consistency across videos of CE GEARS ratings remained low (ICC = 0.38). Despite this, we found that crowdworker GEARS ratings of videos were highly correlated with CE ratings at both the video level (R = 0.82, p < 0.001) and surgeon level (R = 0.84, p < 0.001). Similarly, crowdworker ratings of the renal artery dissection were highly correlated with expert assessments (R = 0.83, p < 0.001) for the unique surgery-specific assessment question. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that crowdsourced assessment of qualitative performance ratings may be an alternative and/or adjunct to surgical experts' ratings and would provide a rapid scalable solution to triage technical skills.",

The purpose of this study was to fill this gap by examining how affect (emotion) mediates this relationship, and more specifically, which emotion(s) mediate. In two studies, participants were presented with different pilot configurations and asked to rate how they felt about them and how willing they would be to fly under those circumstances. Both studies revealed strong evidence that affect was a mediator in this relationship, and that anger, fear, and happiness were the significant emotions in play. The findings from this study provide information on how consumers view modifying the number of pilots that may be on board the aircraft compared with controlling the aircraft remotely. It also identifies that emotions play a significant role in these relationships.",
,,,,593,Learning to generate images with perceptual similarity metrics,"Jake Snell, Karl Ridgeway, Renjie Liao",arXiv,,42736,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06409.pdf,"Deep networks are increasingly being applied to problems involving image synthesis, e.g., generating images from textual descriptions and reconstructing an input image from a compact representation. Supervised training of image-synthesis networks typically uses a pixel-wise loss (PL) to indicate the mismatch between a generated image and its corresponding target image. We propose instead to use a loss function that is better calibrated to human perceptual judgments of image quality: the multiscale structural-similarity score (MS-SSIM) [34]. Because MS-SSIM is differentiable, it is easily incorporated into gradient-descent learning. We compare the consequences of using MS-SSIM versus PL loss on training deterministic and stochastic autoencoders. For three different architectures, we collected human judgments of the quality of image reconstructions. Observers reliably prefer images synthesized by MS-SSIM-optimized models over those synthesized by PL-optimized models, for two distinct PL measures (L1 and L2 distances). We also explore the effect of training objective on image encoding and analyze conditions under which perceptually-optimized representations yield better performance on image classification. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of perceptually-optimized networks for super-resolution imaging. Just as computer vision has advanced through the use of convolutional architectures that mimic the structure of the mammalian visual system, we argue that significant additional advances can be made in modeling images through the use of training objectives that are well aligned to characteristics of human perception.",

Self-report survey data from a U.S. sample of men and women recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (25–89 years, M age = 47.38, SD = 14.05) were used to investigate the extent to which stereotypically masculine traits; stereotypically feminine traits; androgyny; gender identification (i.e., identifying with one’s gender group and viewing this as a positive part of the self); and gender typicality (i.e., viewing oneself as a typical member of one’s gender group) differ between younger (i.e., under age 40), middle-aged (i.e., ages 40–59), and older men and women (i.e., age 60 and older) and by marital status. Results indicate that gender differences in stereotypically masculine and feminine personality traits exist, and that marital status moderates age and gender differences in traits. Among older men, those who are married are more likely to endorse stereotypically masculine traits, but also have higher androgyny scores than unmarried men. With age, both men and women perceive themselves as more typical examples of their gender group. Results are discussed as providing limited support for crossover theory, but not degendering.",

Others have warranted caution based on demographic characteristics and comparisons of reliability. Yet, what is missing is an examination of the most glaring demographic difference in MTurk—religion. We compare five MTurk samples with a student convenience sample and the 2012 General Social Survey, finding that MTurk samples have a consistent bias toward nonreligion. MTurk surveys significantly overrepresent seculars and underrepresent Catholics and evangelical Protestants. We then compare the religiosity of religious identifiers across samples as well as relationships between religiosity and partisanship, finding many similarities and a few important differences from the general population.",

Falk, Matthew Brook O’Donnell, Steven Tompson",Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience,,42401,https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/2/204/2375088/Functional-brain-imaging-predicts-public-health,"Mass media can powerfully affect health decision-making. Pre-testing through focus groups or surveys is a standard, though inconsistent, predictor of effectiveness. Converging evidence demonstrates that activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing can predict individual behavior in response to health messages. Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups can forecast population-level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the psychological processes that link neural activity and population-level outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. We exposed 50 smokers to antismoking messages and used their aggregated neural activity within a ‘self-localizer’ defined region of medial prefrontal cortex to predict the success of the same campaign messages at the population level (n = 400 000 emails). Results demonstrate that: (i) independently localized neural activity during health message exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting population-level campaign responses (model combined R2 up to 0.65) and (ii) this relationship depends on message content—self-related neural processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral images. These data advance understanding of the psychological link between brain and large-scale behavior and may aid the construction of more effective media health campaigns.",

Johnson",Evolution and Human Behavior,,42430,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513815000835,"In order to ensure successful mating opportunities, it is critical that human perceivers accurately infer others’ sexual interests. But how do perceivers achieve these inferences? For over 50 years, scientists have documented that the pupils dilate in response to sexual arousal. Despite the potential importance of this cue for mate selection, however, extant data have focused almost exclusively on the perspective of the individual experiencing arousal. Here, we demonstrate that outside observers exploit pupil dilation as a visible cue to others’ sexual interests. We used reverse-correlation methods to derive facial images based on perceivers’ mental representations of both state-based (sexually aroused, sexually unaroused) and trait-based (sexually promiscuous, sexually non-promiscuous) markers of sexual interest. Next, we explored the phenotypic features that differentiated these faces, specifically the dilation of the pupils contained within each reverse-correlation image. Consistent with the notion that pupil dilation is a reliable cue to sexual arousal, sexually interested faces contained objectively larger and darker pupils than did sexually disinterested faces. Moreover, these differences were perceptually obvious to naïve observers. Collectively, our results suggest that perceivers attend to an external cue – pupil dilation – when forming decisions about others’ state-based and trait-based sexual interests.",

How to build a similar connection for computers? One possible way is via visual concepts, which are text terms that relate to visually discriminative entities.

We illustrate the applications of the discovered concepts using bidirectional image and sentence retrieval task and image tagging task, and show that the discovered concepts not only outperform several large sets of manually selected concepts significantly, but also achieves the stateof-the-art performance in the retrieval task.",

Early work in this growing area of research has revealed that epistemologists’ theories of knowledge diverge in various ways from the ways in which ordinary people think of knowledge. Reflecting the practices of epistemology as a whole, the vast majority of these studies have focused on the concept of propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. Many philosophers, however, have argued that knowing how to do something is importantly different from knowing that something is the case. Hence, in this paper we turn our attention to people’s concept of knowledge-how. We present data from two experiments that employed a sentence recognition task as an implicit measure of conceptual activation. The data from this implicit measure suggest that, contrary to prominent intellectualist theories of know-how, according to which know-how is a species of propositional knowledge, people’s concept of know-how more closely aligns with anti-intellectualism, the view that knowing how to perform some task consists in having the appropriate skills or abilities.",

Questions regarding positive (e.g., smoking reduction/cessation) and negative (e.g., delay of cessation) potential public health consequences of e-cigarettes may be informed by studying dual users of e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes. A cross-sectional online survey assessed demographics, product use patterns, and beliefs about relative product benefits and harms among dual users (n = 350) in the United States using the website Amazon Mechanical Turk. Compared to tobacco cigarettes, e-cigarettes were used less often and were associated with lower dependence. Participants reported a 30% reduction in self-reported tobacco cigarette smoking since beginning to use e-cigarettes. Reported primary reasons for e-cigarette use were harm reduction and smoking cessation. E-cigarette use was reported as more likely in settings with smoking restrictions and when others' health could be adversely affected. Conversely, participants reported having used tobacco cigarettes more often than e-cigarettes in hedonic situations (e.g., after eating, drinking coffee or alcohol, or having sex), outdoors, or when stressed. Participants were twice as likely to report wanting to quit tobacco cigarettes compared to e-cigarettes in the next year and intended to quit tobacco cigarettes sooner. Tobacco cigarettes were described as more harmful and addictive, but also as more enjoyable than e-cigarettes. Participants provided evidence consistent with both positive and negative public health consequences of e-cigarettes, highlighting the need for experimental research, including laboratory studies and clinical trials. Policies should consider potential public health benefits of e-cigarettes, in addition to potential harms.",

Participants view a simple Michotte-style launching sequence featuring 3 objects, in which one object starts moving before its presumed cause. Not only did participants re-order the events in a causally consistent way, thus violating the objective temporal order, but they also failed to recognise the clip they had seen, preferring a clip in which temporal and causal order matched. We show that the effect is not due to lack of attention to the presented events and we discuss the problem of determining whether causality affects temporal order at an early perceptual stage or whether it distorts an accurately perceived order during retrieval. Alternatively, we propose a mechanism by which temporal order is neither misperceived nor misremembered but inferred “on-demand” given phenomenal causality and the temporal priority principle, the assumption that causes precede their effects. Finally, we discuss how, contrary to theories of causal perception, impressions of causality can be generated from dynamic sequences with strong spatiotemporal deviations.",

However, human–robot interactions may be complicated by a hypothetical Uncanny Valley (UV) in which imperfect human-likeness provokes dislike. Previous investigations using unnaturally blended images reported inconsistent UV effects. We demonstrate an UV in subjects’ explicit ratings of likability for a large, objectively chosen sample of 80 real-world robot faces and a complementary controlled set of edited faces. An “investment game” showed that the UV penetrated even more deeply to influence subjects’ implicit decisions concerning robots’ social trustworthiness, and that these fundamental social decisions depend on subtle cues of facial expression that are also used to judge humans. Preliminary evidence suggests category confusion may occur in the UV but does not mediate the likability effect. These findings suggest that while classic elements of human social psychology govern human–robot social interaction, robust UV effects pose a formidable android-specific problem.",

Public opinion is important for successful dissemination of this approach from research into clinical practice. We developed a brief information-based intervention to improve public acceptability. Methods: We recruited 166 adult participants (54.2% females [6.7% pregnant], 25.3% smokers, mean age 32.4 years [ SD , 9.9]) currently living the United States from Amazon Mechanical Turk. They were randomized to either intervention ( N = 84) or control ( N = 82). The control group read educational materials on car safety for pregnant women and young children. The intervention group read educational materials on the rationale behind using financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Key outcomes were 11 opinion items regarding whether using financial incentives to help pregnant smokers to quit is a good idea; its effectiveness, fairness, cost, health benefits, and saved healthcare cost; and pregnant women’s responsibility and difficulty of quitting smoking. Results: Intervention and control groups had similar pretest opinion on using financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy. All 11 mean opinion scores significantly increased in the intervention group, but remained stable in the control group. After the intervention, 27.7% more of participants (from 62.6% to 90.3%; P value < .001) in the intervention group and only 4.8% more (from 64.6% to 69.4%; P value = .557) in the control group agreed that “Paying pregnant women who smoke to quit smoking is a good idea” (interaction P value = .015). Conclusions: Our low-cost information-based intervention has the potential to improve public acceptability of this efficacious approach to promoting smoking cessation during pregnancy. Implications: In this sample of educated young adults, our low-cost information-based intervention substantially improved their acceptability of using financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Our intervention can be used to gain public support before implementing this approach as a policy in the general population. One potential concern that needs to be further addressed by future intervention is unfairness of this smoking cessation approach to pregnant nonsmokers.",

Amazon Mechanical Turk is a web marketplace for crowdsourcing microtasks, such as answering surveys and image tagging. We explored the limits of crowdsourcing by using Mechanical Turk for a more complicated task: analysis and creation of wind simulations. Harnessing Crowdworkers for Engineering: Our investigation examined the feasibility of using crowdsourcing for complex, highly technical tasks. This was done to determine if the benefits of crowdsourcing could be harnessed to accurately and effectively contribute to solving complex real world engineering problems. Of course, untrained crowds cannot be used as a mere substitute for trained expertise. Rather, we sought to understand how crowd workers can be used as a large pool of labor for a preliminary analysis of complex data. Virtual Wind Tunnel: We compared the skill of the anonymous crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk with that of civil engineering graduate students, making a first pass at analyzing wind simulation data. For the first phase, we posted analysis questions to Amazon crowd workers and to two groups of civil engineering graduate students. A second phase of our experiment instructed crowd workers and students to create simulations on our Virtual Wind Tunnel website to solve a more complex task. Conclusions: With a sufficiently comprehensive tutorial and compensation similar to typical crowd-sourcing wages, we were able to enlist crowd workers to effectively complete longer, more complex tasks with competence comparable to that of graduate students with more comprehensive, expert-level knowledge. Furthermore, more complex tasks require increased communication with the workers. As tasks become more complex, the employment relationship begins to become more akin to outsourcing than crowdsourcing. Through this investigation, we were able to stretch and explore the limits of crowdsourcing as a tool for solving complex problems.",

Since evidence suggests that hormones influence several facets of human social behavior, we asked whether SVO might fluctuate across the female menstrual cycle. Using self-report data obtained in two independent online studies, we show that cooperative preferences, as indexed by SVO, are indeed significantly more prosocial in the early follicular compared to the midluteal phase in naturally ovulating women. Furthermore, when estimating hormonal variations from norm data, we found estradiol, but not progesterone or testosterone, to be a significant predictor of SVO across the menstrual cycle in both studies, with a negative correlation. Our findings provide evidence that the willingness to cooperate varies across the natural female menstrual cycle and highlight the potential of investigating psychological effects of ovarian sex hormones.",

The experiments were designed to test a general hypothesis that cue-driven control learns from context-specific histories of prior acts of selective attention. Several web-based flanker studies were conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Attention filtering demands were induced by a secondary one-back memory task after each trial prompting recall of the last target or distractor letter. Blocking recall demands produced larger flanker effects for the distractor than target recall conditions. Mixing recall demands and associating them with particular stimulus-cues (location, colour, letter, and font) sometimes showed rapid, contextual control of flanker interference, and sometimes did not. The results show that subtle methodological parameters can influence whether or not contextual control is observed. More generally, the results show that contextual control phenomena can be influenced by other sources of control, including other cue-driven sources competing for control.",

In this paper we focus on a specific problem – object segmentation within color images – and compare different solutions which combine color image segmentation algorithms with human efforts, either in the form of an explicit interactive segmentation task or through an implicit collection of valuable human traces with a game. We use Click’n’Cut, a friendly, web-based, interactive segmentation tool that allows segmentation tasks to be assigned to many users, and Ask’nSeek, a game with a purpose designed for object detection and segmentation. The two main contributions of this paper are: (i) We use the results of Click’n’Cut campaigns with different groups of users to examine and quantify the crowdsourcing loss incurred when an interactive segmentation task is assigned to paid crowd-workers, comparing their results to the ones obtained when computer vision experts are asked to perform the same tasks. (ii) Since interactive segmentation tasks are inherently tedious and prone to fatigue, we compare the quality of the results obtained with Click’n’Cut with the ones obtained using a (fun, interactive, and potentially less tedious) game designed for the same purpose. We call this contribution the assessment of the gamification loss, since it refers to how much quality of segmentation results may be lost when we switch to a game-based approach to the same task. We demonstrate that the crowdsourcing loss is significant when using all the data points from workers, but decreases substantially (and becomes comparable to the quality of expert users performing similar tasks) after performing a modest amount of data analysis and filtering out of users whose data are clearly not useful. We also show that – on the other hand – the gamification loss is significantly more severe: the quality of the results drops roughly by half when switching from a focused (yet tedious) task to a more fun and relaxed game environment.",

We find that expertise increases confidence in the ability to explain a wide variety of phenomena. However, this confidence is unwarranted; after actually offering full explanations, people are surprised by the limitations in their understanding. For passive expertise (familiar topics), miscalibration is moderated by education; those with more education are accurate in their self-assessments (Experiment 1). But when those with more education consider topics related to their area of concentrated study (college major), they also display an illusion of understanding (Experiment 2). This “curse of expertise” is explained by a failure to recognize the amount of detailed information that had been forgotten (Experiment 3). While expertise can sometimes lead to accurate self-knowledge, it can also create illusions of competence.",

The comparison is performed from a line-up of graphs where a single graph of the actual data is hidden among multiple graphs of sample data. If the real data is discernible, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Here, we illustrate the utility of graphical inference using examples from climatology, biogeography, and health geography. The examples include inferences about location of the mean, change across space and time, and clustering. We show that graphical inference is a useful technique to answer a broad range of common questions in geographical datasets. This approach is needed to avoid the common pitfalls of “straw man” hypotheses and “p-hacking” as datasets become increasingly larger and more complex.",

The mechanism underlying this relation is not well understood, however. Self-compassion is a positive coping strategy that has been negatively related to post-trauma psychopathology in prior work. It was hypothesized that the external resource of social support increased the internal resource of self-compassion, which resulted in decreased psychopathology. The current study tested the hypothesis that the association between social support and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression symptoms had an indirect pathway via self-compassion. Using a community sample of individuals exposed to potentially traumatic events, social support was positively related to self-compassion. Self-compassion was negatively related to PTSD, GAD, and depression symptoms. Self-compassion mediated the relation between social support and PTSD, GAD, and depression symptoms. These results suggest that social support may reduce symptoms of PTSD, GAD, and depression through increased self-compassion in those who experienced a trauma.",

Four studies provide evidence that implicit theories of sexual attraction as either fixed or malleable predict responses to sexual challenges. In Studies 1 and 2, individual differences in these beliefs predicted (above and beyond other implicit theories, relationship beliefs, and measures of sexual desire) perceptions of success for a relationship lacking sexual chemistry. In Study 3, these beliefs predicted actual relationship outcomes in committed couples. Finally, in Study 4, these beliefs predicted willingness to engage in destructive behaviors in response to a sexual challenge—but not in response to a non-sexual challenge—in a hypothetical long-term relationship.

In this article, we posit that reminders of resource scarcity activate a competitive orientation, which guides consumers’ decision making towards advancing their own welfare. Further, we reveal that this tendency can manifest in behaviors that appear selfish, but also in behaviors that appear generous, in conditions where generosity allows for personal gains. The current research thus offers a more nuanced understanding of why resource scarcity may promote behaviors that appear either selfish or generous in different contexts, and provides one way to reconcile seemingly conflicting prior findings.",

Accordingly, we asked NFL fans to predict how many games teams they liked and disliked would win in the 2015 season. Fans, like ESPN reporters assigned to cover a team, were overly optimistic about their team’s prospects. The opposite pattern was found for teams that fans disliked. Optimism may flourish because year-to-year team results are marked by auto-correlation and regression to the group mean (i.e., good teams stay good, but bad teams improve).",

Psych,Cognitive ,emotion,,623,Classification of deceptive opinions using a low dimensionality representation,"Leticia C. Cagnina, Paolo Rosso",X,,42250,http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W15/W15-29.pdf#page=70,"Emotions are an important part of our everyday lives. However, until quite recently, human affect was regarded in a dual manner - positively, for its regulatory power and negatively, as a sort of a ""weakness"" of the human spirit, that should ideally be rational, logical, *thinking* in a very matter of fact and consequence-based fashion. Recent discoveries in Neuropsychology and the possibilities opened by the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging have made it clear that emotions play a very important role for the well-functioning of the human body, both psychologically, as well as physically. Apart from the importance emotions have for each human being individually, research in Social Psychology and disciplines such as Marketing, Mass-media Communication or Political Science, has shown time and time again that the emotional discourse, its content - in words with affective connotation and the combination thereof - is of paramount difference between the success and failure of social actions, consumer products or political candidates. Given that nowadays messages with (sometimes) high emotional connotations are so easily shared using Social Media platforms and that their high volume makes manual sifting mostly impossible, the automatic processing of Subjectivity, Sentiment and Emotions in texts, especially in Social Media contexts is highly relevant. Bearing these observations in mind, the aim of the 6th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2015) was to continue the line of the previous editions, bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. Starting with 2013, WASSA has extended its scope and focus to Social Media phenomena and the impact of affect-related phenomena in this context. The past two editions have shown important breakthroughs in dealing with the challenges of these types of texts, in monolingual, multilingual and cross-domain contexts. WASSA 2015 was organized in conjunction to EMNLP 2015: the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, on September 17, 2015, in Lisboa, Portugal. For this year’s edition of WASSA, we received a total of 48 submissions, from universities and research centers all over the world, out of which 8 were accepted as long and another 16 as short papers. Each paper has been thoroughly reviewed by at least 2 members of the Program Committee. The accepted papers were all highly assessed by the reviewers, the best paper receiving an average punctuation (computed as an average of all criteria used to assess the papers) of 4.8 out of 5. The main topics of the accepted papers are related to challenges in dealing with language and domain diversity in Social Media - the creation and evaluation of resources for subjectivity, sentiment and emotion resources for Twitter mining, but also the use of the particular structure of Social Media texts to improve the sentiment and subjectivity classification. Additionally, articles presenting valuable work concentrating on building lexica for this field demonstrate that there is still a high requirement to develop such resources, taking into account deeper levels of annotations that are inspired by theories in Psychology. Finally, some articles deal with the issue of sentiment visualization and the use of such tools to improve the performance of automatic systems for emotion detection and classification.",

The reason for is that individual’s information and online activities are easily traced, collected and stored in OSNs when compared to face-to-face settings. In this context, this work aims at understanding how similar or different are people’s concerns and attitudes about self-disclosure in both OSNs and face-to-face settings, focusing on investigating what information people consider personal and with whom they feel comfortable in sharing which pieces of their information within these two contexts. Our analysis shows that people associate different degrees of “personalness” to different pieces of information. Furthermore, our data shows that people have different attitudes regarding which information they share in which world and how they share it. This indicates that people understand that OSN and face-to-face settings require different behaviors and that they take into account how personal they perceive a piece of information to be, in deciding if and how to share it.",

In this paper, sentiment analysis of a product is performed by extracting tweets about that product and classifying the tweets showing it as positive and negative sentiment. The authors propose a hybrid approach which combines unsupervised learning in the form of K-means clustering to cluster the tweets and then performing supervised learning methods such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines for classification.",

However, while automatically generated summaries enable people to consume large amounts of data efficiently, they do not provide the context needed for a viewer to fully understand an event. Narrative structure can provide templates for the order and manner in which this data is presented to create stories that are oriented around narrative elements rather than summaries made up of facts. In this paper, we use narrative theory as a framework for identifying the links between social media content. To do this, we designed crowdsourcing tasks to generate summaries of events based on commonly used narrative templates. In a controlled study, for certain types of events, people were more emotionally engaged with stories created with narrative structure and were also more likely to recommend them to others compared to summaries created without narrative structure.",

The problem is highly information intensive, and most of the information required is hard to gather. In this paper, we present a solution approach based on the paradigm of Analytical Open Innovation (AOI). Open innovation is a cheap and low risk problem solving approach which relies on knowledge exchange with outside of company as a competitive advantage. Different forms of open innovation; crowd source, open source and outsource; facilitate the provider and consumer interactions and brings higher customer value. In our proposed AOI approach, open innovation is utilized for elicitation of services from web data, crowdsourcing the service value from potential customers and for the estimation of service implementation effort. For service evaluation, we apply the Kano theory of product development and customer satisfaction. Based on that and as the result from an optimization process, resource-optimized service portfolios are created that constitute trade-offs in balancing between gained value and effort needed. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is illustrated via a case study project for the composition of Over the Top TV (OTT) services. The atomic services from 241 qualified apps were analyzed from the android app market. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to generate optimized trade-off solutions, composing better apps at each capacity level and achieving better customer satisfaction .The level of improvement in customer satisfaction varies between 16.5% and 95.3%.",

For example, Newman et al. (2003) examined lying in written communication, finding that deceptive utterances used more total words but fewer personal pronouns. However, relatively few studies have focused on speech or writing style, which can be used to aid in authorship attribution and plagiarism identification (Cristani et al., 2012), and would thus seem to prove valuable for detecting deception. Recently, efforts have been made to remedy this by extending the application of linguistic feature analysis. For example, Rubin and Lukoianova (2014) applied Mann and Thompson’s (1987) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to elicited written narratives that participants self-identified as either truthful or deceitful. Their findings suggest that RST relations, illustrative of functional relationships between ‘spans’ of text, vary based on the truthfulness of the narratives. However, this study, like previous studies, relies on researcherprompted untruths rather than naturally occurring ones. As such, participants have little motivation to make the deception believable, unlike in real-world situations. The present study thus combines linguistic analysis with an examination of naturally occurring deception in the high-stakes setting of the State of Florida versus Casey Marie Anthony, in order to determine if findings like those of Rubin and Lukoianova (2014) are generalizable to deceptive statements in real-world settings. From publically available legal case documents, a corpus of 724 words (65 text segments) was selected and RST relations were coded. While some of Rubin and Lukoianova’s (2014) findings were minimally supported, no strong correlation between relations and the truth value of an utterance were found, suggesting the need for additional research in this area.",

Samuel Winer",Journal of Affective Disorders,,42370,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032715302664,"Background: Suicide is a major clinical and public health issue, especially in people with disabilities. However, research on the acceptability of suicide in people with disabilities has not directly compared the relative acceptability of suicidality in people with and without disabilities. Method: An online sample of five hundred American adults read five pairs of vignettes about individuals who were experiencing suicidal ideation following a life stressor. Each pair contained a disability and no-disability condition; a sixth pair of vignettes discussed suicidal ideation in an elderly individual and contained physical and cognitive disability conditions. Participants completed questions regarding the relative acceptability of suicidality for each vignette as well as demographic items and measures of suicidality, depressive symptoms, and attitude towards disability. Results: In all vignette five pairs, suicidality was seen as significantly more acceptable in the disability condition; this was true even when the participants themselves had disabilities or friends or family members with disabilities. Suicidality, depressive symptomology, and more negative attitudes towards disability predicted greater acceptability in both conditions; no factors predicted greater differences between the two conditions. Limitations: The vignettes in this study focused primarily on individuals in their 20s and most did not compare two disabling conditions. Conclusions: The greater social acceptability of suicidality in people with disabilities may be taken by individuals with disabilities who are suicidal as implicit permission to end their lives. The potential impact of such social influences should be assessed and addressed by clinicians and suicide prevention advocates.",

The authors conducted three studies that revealed a general tendency to favor oneself over one's partner in direct self–partner personality comparisons. This illustrated a motivational precedence of self-enhancement over partner-enhancement goals. In Study 1, participants rated self-only traits more favorably than partner-only traits. In Studies 2 and 3, participants rated desirable traits as more characteristic of themselves than their partner, particularly when traits were more relevant to personal than relationship success. The authors also found that this self-favoring bias was weaker (typically nonexistent) among those with higher relationship satisfaction, lower self-esteem, or lower self-deceptive tendencies. The authors discuss practical, theoretical, and methodological implications.",

Past research suggests that attitude certainty is one important determinant. The current research seeks to provide more nuanced insight into this relationship by (a) exploring the unique roles of attitude clarity and attitude correctness, and (b) mapping clarity and correctness onto different forms of advocacy (sharing intentions and persuasion intentions). Across four studies, we find that correctness but not clarity plays an important role in promoting persuasion intentions, whereas both correctness and clarity help shape sharing intentions. Thus, this research unpacks the certainty–advocacy relation and helps identify experimental manipulations that uniquely drive persuasion and sharing intentions.",

However, the theoretical explanations regarding the effectiveness of the tactic and the effects of LPC messages on donation amounts warrant further consideration. A meta-analytic review of LPC research was conducted to examine these issues. Consistent with a prior meta-analysis, LPC messages increased compliance rates (r = .22, k = 34, n = 3,181) relative to control conditions. Three moderators were also tested. The results indicated that impression management concerns and perceptions of requestor need explained the effects of LPC messages on compliance rates. A second analysis (r = −.23, k = 11, n = 1,531) offered evidence that LPC messages led to smaller mean donation amounts. A third analysis showed that LPC messages produced similar donation totals relative to control messages.",

Many theories suggest that dehumanization happens in order to facilitate aggression or account for past immorality. We suggest a novel motivation for dehumanization: to avoid affective costs. We show that dehumanization of stigmatized targets (e.g., drug addicts) relative to nonstigmatized targets is strongest for those who are motivated to avoid emotional exhaustion. In Experiment 1, participants anticipated more exhaustion from helping, and attributed less mind to, a stigmatized target and anticipated exhaustion partially mediated the influence of stigma on mind attribution. Experiment 2 manipulated anticipated exhaustion prior to an empathy plea and revealed that the influence of stigma on mind attribution was only present when people anticipated high levels of emotional exhaustion.",

It has not been shown, however, whether witnessing this counterattitudinal behavior arouses vicarious dissonance because it contradicts the attitudes of the observed ingroup member or for egocentric reasons — that is, because it contradicts the attitudes of the observer. In three experiments, we test the hypothesis that the conditions necessary for arousing vicarious dissonance—namely, observing an ingroup member's responsibility for aversive consequences and level of choice—are processed egocentrically by the observer. By manipulating perspective taking in a vicarious induced compliance task, and manipulating choice difficulty in a vicarious free-choice dissonance paradigm, we show that the arousal of vicarious dissonance crucially depends on the consequences of the ingroup member's actions for the observer, and not for the observed ingroup member. Implications for other aspects of vicarious dissonance and vicarious experience in general are discussed.",

This content is often very uneven in quality and topical coverage in different languages. The lack of material in individual languages means that cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) within these collections is required to satisfy the user’s information need. Search over this content is dependent on available metadata, which includes user-generated annotations and often noisy transcripts of spoken audio. The effectiveness of CLIR depends on translation quality between query and content languages. We investigate CLIR effectiveness for the blip10000 archive of user-generated Internet video content. We examine the retrieval effectiveness using the title and free-text metadata provided by the uploader and automatic speech recognition (ASR) generated transcripts. Retrieval is carried out using the Divergence From Randomness models, and automatic translation using Google translate. Our experimental investigation indicates that different sources of evidence have different retrieval effectiveness and in particular differing levels of performance in CLIR. Specifically, we find that the retrieval effectiveness of the ASR source is significantly degraded in CLIR. Our investigation also indicates that for this task the Title source provides the most robust source of evidence for CLIR, and performs best when used in combination with other sources of evidence. We suggest areas for investigation to give most effective and robust CLIR performance for user-generated content.",

Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a commonly stigmatized ingredient, despite it being consistently deemed safe for human consumption by experts. This study examined three strategies for correcting the stigmatization of MSG. Using three treatments and a control condition, the study compares the effectiveness of different corrective communication strategies using a test–retest design. Results from 1308 participants presents strong evidence that providing factual information in the form of a rational appeal is a highly effective strategy for increasing the willingness and likelihood of consuming MSG. The findings demonstrate that an endorsement from a celebrity (in this research Chef Heston Blumenthal) as a form of emotional appeal is less effective at improving such perceptions. The study also tests for a minority ‘backlash’ effect among some participants, whose misperceptions may strengthen in the face of disconfirming evidence. The implications for improved food labeling and consumer wellbeing are discussed.",

Rogge",Research in Developmental Disabilities,,December 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422215001183,"Increases in intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) diagnoses coupled with higher rates of inclusion in school and community settings, has created more opportunities for exposure and integration between those with IDD and the mainstream population. Previous research has found that increased contact can lead to more positive attitudes toward those with IDD. The current study further investigated this impact of contact on attitudes by examining the influence of the quality and quantity of contact on both explicit and implicit levels of prejudice, while also considering potential mediation via intergroup anxiety and implicit attitudes. Based on past research and theory, we predicted that contact (especially quality contact) would have a strong relationship with explicit and implicit positive attitudes toward individuals with IDD. In the present study, 550 people completed a survey and short task that measured their level of contact with individuals with IDD across their lifetime, their current attitudes toward these individuals, and other constructs that are thought to influence this relationship. Multiple regression analyses suggested consistent links between higher quality of contact and lower levels of prejudice toward individuals with IDD at both the explicit and implicit levels. After controlling for quality of contact, higher quantity of contact was either not significantly associated with our measures of prejudice or was, importantly, associated with higher levels of prejudice. Additional analyses support intergroup anxiety and implicit positive attitudes as significant mediators in the associations between quality of contact and the various dimensions of explicit prejudice. Thus, it would seem that it is the quality of interpersonal interactions that is most strongly related to positive attitudes toward individuals with IDD, making it crucial to take care when developing inclusion opportunities in community settings.",42620

Recent research, however, hints that suggestion is not necessary: Simply changing the order of a set of trivia questions altered people’s beliefs about their accuracy on those questions (Weinstein & Roediger, Memory & Cognition, 38, 366–376, 2010, Memory & Cognition, 40, 727–735, 2012). We wondered to what degree eyewitnesses' beliefs—and in turn the jurors who evaluate them—would be affected by this simple change to the order in which they answer questions. Across six experiments, we show that the order of questions matters. Eyewitnesses reported higher accuracy and were more confident about their memory when questions seemed initially easy, than when they seemed initially difficult. Moreover, jurors’ beliefs about eyewitnesses closely matched those of the eyewitnesses themselves.

One of the most prominent examples of crowd-sourced information on the Internet is Wikipedia, a free and open encyclopedia created and edited entirely by users, and one of the world’s most accessed websites. While previous studies of crowd-sourced information platforms have found them to be accurate, few have considered biases in what kinds of information are included. We report the results of four randomized field experiments that sought to explore what biases exist in the political articles of this collaborative website. By randomly assigning factually true but either positive or negative and cited or uncited information to the Wikipedia pages of U.S. senators, we uncover substantial evidence of an editorial bias toward positivity on Wikipedia: Negative facts are 36% more likely to be removed by Wikipedia editors than positive facts within 12 hours and 29% more likely within 3 days. Although citations substantially increase an edit’s survival time, the editorial bias toward positivity is not eliminated by inclusion of a citation. We replicate this study on the Wikipedia pages of deceased as well as recently retired but living senators and find no evidence of an editorial bias in either. Our results demonstrate that crowd-sourced information is subject to an editorial bias that favors the politically active.",

To address this question, we systematically compared the core object recognition behavior of two monkeys with that of human subjects. To test true object recognition behavior (rather than image matching), we generated several thousand naturalistic synthetic images of 24 basic-level objects with high variation in viewing parameters and image background. Monkeys were trained to perform binary object recognition tasks on a match-to-sample paradigm. Data from 605 human subjects performing the same tasks on Mechanical Turk were aggregated to characterize “pooled human” object recognition behavior, as well as 33 separate Mechanical Turk subjects to characterize individual human subject behavior. Our results show that monkeys learn each new object in a few days, after which they not only match mean human performance but show a pattern of object confusion that is highly correlated with pooled human confusion patterns and is statistically indistinguishable from individual human subjects. Importantly, this shared human and monkey pattern of 3D object confusion is not shared with low-level visual representations (pixels, V1+; models of the retina and primary visual cortex) but is shared with a state-of-the-art computer vision feature representation. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that rhesus monkeys and humans share a common neural shape representation that directly supports object perception.",

Although researchers have spent a considerable amount of attention disentangling this form of implicit (unconscious) racial bias from explicit (conscious) racial bias, we are less clear about the conditions that cause implicit racism to matter in American politics. In this article, we offer a theory of how fear and Whites' unconscious racial bias are tightly linked in memory, and triggering this emotion can make these implicit attitudes more salient in public opinion. To test our theory, we focus on Whites’ opinions toward voter ID laws. Our expectation is that inducing fear should cause implicit racism to play an important role in Whites’ evaluation of the policy. Using an adult national experiment over two waves, we induced several emotions to elicit fear, anger, or relaxation. The findings show that the fear condition causes Whites high in implicit racism to be more supportive of voter ID laws than similar individuals in the anger and control conditions. On the other hand, fear does not cause Whites high in explicit racism to be more supportive of voter ID laws.",

Additionally, we provide evidence that each of these results offer different and unique insight into the variation of the obesity rate in urban areas within the United States.

Although research suggests biological models of EDs reduce blame-oriented stigma in the general public, their effect on symptomatic individuals' attitudes toward themselves, treatment, and their prognosis has not been studied. Additionally, little is known about how other credible forms of conceptualizing ED development (e.g., cognitive-behavioral) affect individuals with disordered eating. Accordingly, the present study assessed the effects of three different forms of psychoeducation about ED development (biology-only, malleability of biology, cognitive-behavioral) among a sample high in ED symptoms. Participants (N = 216) viewed an audiovisual presentation describing ED development from one of the three perspectives before completing measures of self-blame for symptoms, prognostic expectations, self-efficacy in recovering, and attitudes toward a description of cognitive-behavioral therapy. There were no significant differences between conditions in self-blame. Relative to biology-only, the psychoeducational messages emphasizing malleable biology and cognitive-behavioral factors produced more prognostic optimism and self-efficacy in recovering. Perceived credibility of cognitive-behavioral therapy and expectations for its efficacy were highest in the cognitive-behavioral psychoeducation condition. Implications for efforts to educate the public and treatment-seeking individuals about the nature of EDs are discussed.",42618

In two experiments, one laboratory-based and one internet-based, each participant completed 36 problems with factorially manipulated probabilities. Many participants applied consistent strategies involving use of only one of the three probabilities provided in the problem, or additive combination of two of the probabilities. There was, however, substantial variability across participants in which probabilities were taken into account. In the laboratory experiment, participants’ eye movements were tracked as they read the problems. There was evidence of a relationship between information use and attention to a source of information. Participants’ self-assessments of their performance, however, revealed little confidence that the strategies they applied were actually correct. These results suggest that the hypothesis of base rate neglect actually underestimates people’s difficulty with Bayesian reasoning, but also suggest that participants are aware of their ignorance.",

Compensatory control theory proposes that when an individual’s perception of her or his own control is threatened, the individual can turn to external systems that may provide a perception of control (e.g., organized government). Conversely, the theory also predicts that when external systems of control are threatened, individuals may respond by exaggerating perceptions of personal control, although this effect has received relatively little empirical support. In the present study, we examined how a threat to an external system of economic control affects individual perceptions of personal control. Specifically, we found that a threat to the perceived distribution of economic resources based on hard work and effort (i.e., meritocracy) led to greater perceptions of personal control. Moreover, this increase in personal control directly increased participants’ optimism about their future economic outcomes. This study provides important insight into the broad influence of external systems on individuals' perceptions of personal control and assessment of future action.",

Bjork",The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,,February 2016,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2015.1085586,"People often think of themselves and their experiences in a more positive light than is objectively justified. Inhibitory control processes may promote this positivity bias by modulating the accessibility of negative thoughts and episodes from the past, which then limits their influence in the construction of imagined future events. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the correlation between retrieval-induced forgetting and the extent to which individuals imagine positive and negative episodic future events. First, we measured performance on a task requiring participants to imagine personal episodic events (either positive or negative), and then we correlated that measure with retrieval-induced forgetting. As predicted, individuals who exhibited higher levels of retrieval-induced forgetting imagined fewer negative episodic future events than did individuals who exhibited lower levels of retrieval-induced forgetting. This finding provides new insight into the possible role of retrieval-induced forgetting in autobiographical memory.",

Participants responded to measures of leisure frequency and quality, SWB, and CA. The results of a multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the frequency of relaxation, achievement, and social leisure activities had no effect on SWB and CA. However, regression analyses indicated that the quality of social leisure activities significantly predicted SWB and the quality of achievement and social leisure activities significantly predicted CA. The quality of relaxation leisure activities was not associated with SWB and CA. Findings indicate that counselors who work with unemployed emerging adults can use leisure activities to promote SWB and CA. Future research to better understand the role of leisure in well-being and career development among emerging adults is encouraged.",

Mattila",International Journal of Hospitality Management,,October 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431915001280,"In the current research, we investigate how employees’ adoption of wearable technology (i.e., a front-line employee using Google Glass for a hotel check-in) influences consumers’ service encounter evaluations and revisit intentions. Building on the theoretical frameworks of technology objectification effect, person sensitivity bias and gender stereotypes, we find that wearable technology has a differential impact on service evaluations based on the employee's gender. Study 1 demonstrates that for female employees, the adoption of wearable technology leads to more favorable customer evaluations in service failure encounters. Study 2 shows that for male employees, the adoption of wearable technology leads to less favorable customer evaluations in service success encounters. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.",

Pelletier , Alisha Blakeney Horky",Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,,July 1905,http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JRIM-09-2014-0059,"Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to expand the knowledge of the current literature stream and to attempt to more fully understand the simple but singularly unique aspect of social networking communication that is the Facebook “Like”. To this end, motivations behind liking a brand are explored, as well as the interactions that occur between the company and consumer as a result of this Facebook interaction. Next, we look at differing levels of interaction for liked product and service brands on Facebook. Specifically exploring if there are differences with how Facebook users engage with liked product and service brands. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first engage in an exploratory, qualitative-based research to look at the motivations and consequences associated with liking product and service brands, using a sample of 160 Facebook users. Next, an ANOVA analysis is performed using an online sample of 264 respondents recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings: The qualitative analysis reveals differing motivations for liking brands on Facebook and suggests that generating Facebook Likes can indeed have positive, if unacknowledged, outcomes for the firm. Further, while there is no significant difference in perceptions of brand knowledge between product- and service-based brands, there is a significant difference in perceptions of brand connectedness between brand types, with consumers reporting a greater sense of connection to the service brands and higher levels of brand attitude and purchase intention for product-based brands. It is also shown that consumers have a greater intention of reading and liking posts from product-based brands. Originality/value: This paper explores and attempts to move toward clarification of the gap that exists between “quality” versus “quantity” valuations of a Facebook Like.",

Data were collected in a cross-sectional study (N = 209, 64% women, Mage = 30 years old) as well as a 1-month daily experience study of individuals who just went through a romantic breakup (N = 117, 44% women, Mage = 27 years old). Findings from both studies revealed that those with stronger fear of being single (Spielmann et al., 2013) reported greater longing for their ex-partners. Pre- to post-breakup analyses revealed that fear of being single increased after a breakup, regardless of who initiated the breakup. Within-day analyses revealed that longing for an ex-partner and attempts to renew the relationship were greater on days with stronger fear of being single. Lagged-day analyses provided support for the conclusion that fear of being single increased longing and renewal attempts over time, but longing and renewal attempts did not influence fear of being single. These findings suggest that fear of being single is a particularly useful construct for understanding the romantic detachment process.",42616

Yet little is known about who forms more international friendships. Here, we propose social class plays a key role in determining people's internationalism. We conducted two studies to test whether social class is related positively to internationalism (the building social class hypothesis) or negatively to internationalism (the restricting social class hypothesis). In Study 1, we found that among individuals in the United States, social class was negatively related to percentage of friends on Facebook that are outside the United States. In Study 2, we extended these findings to the global level by analyzing country-level data on Facebook friends formed in 2011 (nearly 50 billion friendships) across 187 countries. We found that people from higher social class countries (as indexed by GDP per capita) had lower levels of internationalism—that is, they made more friendships domestically than abroad.",
MTurk Method,,,,653,The Importance of Assessing Clinical Phenomena in Mechanical Turk Research.,"Arditte KA, Çek D, Shaw AM",Psychological Assessment,,August 2015,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302105,"Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) website provides a data collection platform with quick and inexpensive access to diverse samples. Numerous reports have lauded MTurk as capturing high-quality data with an epidemiological sample that is more representative of the U.S. population than traditional in-person convenience samples (e.g., undergraduate subject pools). This benefit, in combination with the ease and low-cost of data collection, has led to a remarkable increase in studies using MTurk to investigate phenomena across a wide range of psychological disciplines. Multiple reports have now examined the demographic characteristics of MTurk samples. One key gap remains, however, in that relatively little is known about individual differences in clinical symptoms among MTurk participants. This paper discusses the importance of assessing clinical phenomena in MTurk samples and supports its assertions through an empirical investigation of a large sample (N = 1,098) of MTurk participants. Results revealed that MTurk participants endorse clinical symptoms to a substantially greater degree than traditional nonclinical samples. This distinction was most striking for depression and social anxiety symptoms, which were endorsed at levels comparable with individuals with clinically diagnosed mood and anxiety symptoms. Participants' symptoms of physiological anxiety, hoarding, and eating pathology fell within the subclinical range. Overall, the number of individuals exceeding validated clinical cutoffs was between 3 and 19 times the estimated 12-month prevalence rates. Based on the current findings, it is argued that MTurk participants differ from the general population in meaningful ways, and researchers should consider this when referring to this sample as truly representative.",42608

Six-hundred men from the USA were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) online data collection site to complete surveys assessing self-perceptions of gender role discrepancy and consequent discrepancy stress, substance use/abuse, driving while intoxicated (DWI) and violent assaults. Negative binomial regression analyses indicated significant interactive effects wherein men high on gender role discrepancy and attendant discrepancy stress reported significantly more assaults with a weapon (B=1.01; SE=0.63; IRR=2.74; p=0.05) and assaults causing injury (B=1.01; SE=0.51; IRR=2.74; p<0.05). There was no association of discrepancy stress to substance abuse, but there was a protective effect of gender role discrepancy for DWI among men low on discrepancy stress (B=−1.19, SE=0.48; IRR=0.30; p=0.01). These findings suggest that gender role discrepancy and associated discrepancy stress, in particular, represent important injury risk factors and that prevention of discrepancy stress may prevent acts of violence with the greatest consequences and costs to the victim, offender and society.",

O’Connor",,,August 2015,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272989X15602000,"Background. Lower numerical ability is associated with poorer understanding of health statistics, such as risk reductions of medical treatment. For many people, despite good numeracy skills, math provokes anxiety that impedes an ability to evaluate numerical information. Math-anxious individuals also report less confidence in their ability to perform math tasks. We hypothesized that, independent of objective numeracy, math anxiety would be associated with poorer responding and lower confidence when calculating risk reductions of medical treatments. Methods. Objective numeracy was assessed using an 11-item objective numeracy scale. A 13-item self-report scale was used to assess math anxiety. In experiment 1, participants were asked to interpret the baseline risk of disease and risk reductions associated with treatment options. Participants in experiment 2 were additionally provided a graphical display designed to facilitate the processing of math information and alleviate effects of math anxiety. Confidence ratings were provided on a 7-point scale. Results. Individuals of higher objective numeracy were more likely to respond correctly to baseline risks and risk reductions associated with treatment options and were more confident in their interpretations. Individuals who scored high in math anxiety were instead less likely to correctly interpret the baseline risks and risk reductions and were less confident in their risk calculations as well as in their assessments of the effectiveness of treatment options. Math anxiety predicted confidence levels but not correct responding when controlling for objective numeracy. The graphical display was most effective in increasing confidence among math-anxious individuals. Conclusions. The findings suggest that math anxiety is associated with poorer medical risk interpretation but is more strongly related to confidence in interpretations.",
,,,,658,Learning Problem‐Solving Rules as Search Through a Hypothesis Space,"Hee Seung Lee, Shawn Betts, John R. Anderson",Cognitive Science,,August 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12275/full,"Learning to solve a class of problems can be characterized as a search through a space of hypotheses about the rules for solving these problems. A series of four experiments studied how different learning conditions affected the search among hypotheses about the solution rule for a simple computational problem. Experiment 1 showed that a problem property such as computational difficulty of the rules biased the search process and so affected learning. Experiment 2 examined the impact of examples as instructional tools and found that their effectiveness was determined by whether they uniquely pointed to the correct rule. Experiment 3 compared verbal directions with examples and found that both could guide search. The final experiment tried to improve learning by using more explicit verbal directions or by adding scaffolding to the example. While both manipulations improved learning, learning still took the form of a search through a hypothesis space of possible rules. We describe a model that embodies two assumptions: (1) the instruction can bias the rules participants hypothesize rather than directly be encoded into a rule; (2) participants do not have memory for past wrong hypotheses and are likely to retry them. These assumptions are realized in a Markov model that fits all the data by estimating two sets of probabilities. First, the learning condition induced one set of Start probabilities of trying various rules. Second, should this first hypothesis prove wrong, the learning condition induced a second set of Choice probabilities of considering various rules. These findings broaden our understanding of effective instruction and provide implications for instructional design.",

When these organizational failures occur, consumers sometimes complain directly to companies. This type of behavior may be considered adaptive insofar as it helps individuals rectify their problems and allows organizations to fix issues for others as well. However, not all consumers complain to companies when they experience dissatisfaction; instead, many people choose to engage in less adaptive behaviors such as spreading negative word of mouth or withholding their patronage. This study was conducted to examine how variables related to protection motivation theory (i.e., threat, coping, and cost) relate to consumers’ choices regarding complaint behaviors. Four hundred fifty-four participants were solicited online to respond to hypothetical scenarios regarding organizational failures. The data indicated participants’ perceptions of threat and cost interacted to predict complaining behavior. Results are discussed as they pertain to organizational practices.",
,,,,660,Service Assurance Framework for Enterprise Task Crowdsourcing,"Chithralekha Balamurugan, Karan K. Budhraja",IEEE,,August 2015,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7207407/,"Crowd sourcing platforms enable enterprise requesters to leverage the online workforce to process voluminous enterprise tasks on a regular basis. Web services provided by these platforms facilitate requesters to post tasks, retrieve results and incentivize crowd workers. However, service assurance associated with task execution by crowd workers is not provided by these platforms. Owing to the flexible, uncommitted, discretionary working patterns of online crowd workers, service assurance for task execution is considered to be beyond the service assurance offerings of existing crowd sourcing platforms. Enterprises however, require these guarantees to be able to adopt crowd sourcing in a profound manner. In this paper, we propose a Service Assurance Framework as a crowd sourcing platform augmenting service, that provides service assurance for task execution by crowd workers. The framework helps enterprise requesters to identify and engage with workers who possess suitable service assurance attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a first of its kind, in providing service assurance associated with task execution by crowd workers, with respect to enterprise tasks. We implemented the proposed framework and conducted a four-week long, large scale crowd sourcing experiment involving digitization of forms posted by an enterprise requester. Our results validate the efficacy of the proposed service assurance framework for enterprise crowd sourcing and advocate its adoption.",

Since cigarette and alcohol use co-occur, we hypothesized that e-cig and alcohol use also co-occur, likely due to shared positive drug expectations. Using self-report data from two independent samples of community-dwelling alcohol using adults, the present study: (1) modified the Nicotine and Other Substance Interaction Expectancy Questionnaire (NOSIE) to assess expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use (i.e. the individuals perceived likelihood of using e-cigs and alcohol together; NOSIE-ER); and (2) examined the relationships among e-cig use, expectancies, and alcohol use across e-cig use status. In the first sample (N = 692, mean age = 32.6, SD = 9.74, 50.7% female, 82.2% Caucasian), exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of two factors: (1) alcohol use leads to e-cig use (Scale 1; α = 0.85); and (2) e-cig use leads to alcohol use (Scale 2; α = 0.91). In the second sample (N = 714, mean age = 34.1, SD = 10.89, 47.8% female, 75.6% Caucasian), confirmatory factor analysis supported this factor structure (χ2 = 47.00, p < 0.01, df = 19; RMSEA = 0.08, 90% CI = 0.05–0.11; TLI = 0.99; CFI = 0.99). Compared to non e-cig users, e-cig users had significantly higher problematic alcohol use in both samples (b's = 0.09 to 0.14, p's < .05). Expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use were significantly related to problematic alcohol use (b's = − 0.92 to 0.26, p's < .05). In sum, e-cig use is related to alcohol use and expectancies of combined e-cig and alcohol use; consequently, reshaping of beliefs about needs or desires to co-use could be a prime point of intervention.",

These attitudes have important implications for some ethical arguments about euthanasia. Two experiments suggested that some different descriptions of euthanasia have modest effects on people’s moral permissibility judgments regarding euthanasia. Experiment 1 (N = 422) used two different types of materials (scenarios and scales) and found that describing euthanasia differently (‘euthanasia’, ‘aid in dying’, and ‘physician assisted suicide’) had modest effects (≈3 % of the total variance) on permissibility judgments. These effects were largely replicated in Experiment 2 (N = 409). However, in Experiment 2, judgments about euthanasia’s moral permissibility were best predicted by the voluntariness of the treatment. Voluntariness was a stronger predictor than some demographic factors and some domain general elements of moral judgments. These results help inform some debates about the moral permissibility of euthanasia (e.g., the slippery slope argument) suggesting that some of the key premises of those arguments are unwarranted.",

The first experiment shows that the late entrant can surpass the pioneer by adopting either a distinctive (new, non-alignable attribute) or enhancing (improved, alignable attribute) strategy depending on the value relevance of the new attributes. The second experiment provides evidence that pricing cues become instrumental when the value relevance of the late entrant with a distinctive strategy is low. In this context, the findings show that increasing the price of the product counter-intuitively enhances the preferences for the late entrant.",

Siegel, Mario A. Navarro, Andrew L. Thomson",Social Science & Medicine,,October 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615300721,"Rationale: Investigations conducted through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) sometimes explicitly note eligibility requirements when recruiting participants; however, the impact of this practice on data integrity is relatively unexplored within the MTurk context. Objective: Contextualized in the organ donor registration domain, the current study assessed whether overtly listing eligibility requirements impairs the accuracy of data collected on MTurk. Methods: On day 1, the first and third round of data collection did not list eligibility requirements; the second and fourth round overtly listed a qualification requirement: status as a non-registered organ donor. On day 2, the approach was identical, except the order was reversed—the first and third round overtly listed the study qualifications, while the second and fourth did not. These procedures provided eight different waves of data. In addition, all participants were randomly assigned to read an elevating (i.e., morally inspiring) story or a story not intended to elicit any emotion. Regardless of recruitment approach, only participants who were not registered as donors were included in the analysis. Results: Results indicated that the recruitment script that explicitly requested non-registered donors resulted in the collection of participants with higher mean intentions scores than the script that did not overtly list the eligibility requirements. Further, even though the elevation induction increased intentions to register as a donor, there was not a significant interaction between recruitment approach and the influence of the elevation manipulation on registration intentions. Conclusion: Explicitly listing eligibility requirements can influence the accuracy of estimates derived from data collected through MTurk.",42605

Our aim was to determine the anxiety and stress associated with possible internet hacking. We utilized an online survey, sampling 304 adult participants. We assessed resting anxiety – that is, “worry, anxiety, or stress” reported at the beginning of the survey. We also assessed anxiety related to possible data breaches. Internet hacking (or “Data breach”) anxiety was rated with somewhat greater severity than resting anxiety. Higher resting anxiety was not related to data breach-related anxiety, indicating that data breach anxiety is specific. Demographic characteristics and secure online practices were not associated with internet hacking anxiety. Anxiety related to data breaches is important to study. However, behaviors intended to protect internet security are rare; education and intervention is needed to reduce anxiety and increase internet security.",

Based upon prior speculations that emotion regulation could be important for understanding the association between happiness emotion goals and depression, in Study 1, we examined whether expressive suppression moderated the association between happiness emotion goals and depressive symptoms using a sample of community adults located in the United States (N = 465). Contrary to study predictions, expressive suppression did not moderate that association. In Study 2, we proposed and examined whether negative mood regulation (NMR) expectancies moderated the association between happiness emotion goals and depressive symptoms among an independent sample of community adults located in the United States (N = 439). Along with replicating Study 1 findings, we found support for the proposed moderating effect of NMR expectancies in Study 2. Happiness emotion goals were only associated with depressive symptoms when individuals held low NMR expectancies. Conceptual and therapeutic implications are discussed.",

In addition, evidence suggests that associations between PTS-related risk factors and PTS symptoms may depend on the degree to which one can tolerate experiencing negative emotions. To better understand the association between mental contamination and PTS symptoms, we examined main and interactive effects of mental contamination and tolerance of negative emotions in relation to PTS symptoms, including specific symptom clusters, in a community sample of women who experienced sexual trauma (N = 101). Tolerance of negative emotions moderated the association between mental contamination and PTS symptoms (total symptom severity, intrusion cluster, and cognitive/mood alterations cluster). These results indicate that difficulties tolerating negative emotions may be a necessary condition for mental contamination to relate to PTS symptoms following sexual trauma.",

This study employed a novel sexual discounting task to elucidate the effects of social learning and regret expression on delay to sexual gratification in a behavioral task. Methods: Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers were assigned to hear one of three scenarios about a friend who engages in similar sexual behavior. The scenarios included a positive health consequence, a negative health consequence or a negative health consequence with the expression of regret. After reading one scenario, participants were asked to select from 60 images, those with whom they would have casual sex. Of the selected images, participants chose one image each for the person they most and least want to have sex with and person most and least likely to have a sexually transmitted infection. They then answered questions about engaging in unprotected sex now or waiting some delay for condom-protected sex in each partner condition. Results: Results indicate that the negative health outcome scenario with regret expression resulted in delayed sexual gratification in the most attractive and least STI partner conditions, whereas in the least attractive and most STI partner conditions the negative health outcome with and without regret resulted in delayed sexual gratification. Conclusions: Results suggest that the sexual discounting task is a relevant laboratory measure and the framing of information to include regret expression may be relevant for prevention of risky sexual behavior.",

Love,Games,,August 2015,http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/6/3/251/htm,"People in a changing environment must decide between exploiting options they currently favor and exploring alternative options that provide additional information about the state of the environment. For example, drivers must decide between purchasing gas at their currently favored station (i.e., exploit) or risk a fruitless trip to another station to evaluate whether the price has been lowered since the last visit. Previous laboratory studies on exploratory choice have found that people choose strategically and explore alternative options when it is more likely that the relative value of competing options has changed. Our study extends this work by considering how global trends (which affect all options equally) influence exploratory choice. For example, during an economic crisis, global gas prices may increase or decrease at all stations, yet consumers should still explore strategically to find the best option. Our research question is whether people can maintain effective exploration strategies in the presence of global trends that are irrelevant in that they do not affect the relative value of choice options. We find that people explore effectively irrespective of global trends.",

Participants (N = 316) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions; (a) a brief conspiracy video about global warming, (b) an inspirational pro-climate video or (c) a control group. Results indicate that those participants who were exposed to the conspiracy video were significantly less likely to think that there is widespread scientific agreement on human-caused climate change, less likely to sign a petition to help reduce global warming and less likely to donate or volunteer for a charity in the next six months. These results strongly point to the socio-cognitive potency of conspiracies and highlight that exposure to popular conspiracy theories can have negative and undesirable societal consequences.",

As social networks and microblogging services become more popular, the need to mine and analyze their content grows. We study the task of sentiment analysis in the well-known social network Twitter (https://twitter.com/). We present a case study on tweets written in Greek and propose an effective method that categorizes Greek tweets as positive, negative and neutral according to their sentiment. We validate our method’s effectiveness on both Greek and English to check its robustness on multilingual challenges, and present the first multilingual comparative study with three pre-existing state of the art techniques for Twitter sentiment extraction on English tweets. Last but not least, we examine the importance of different preprocessing techniques in different languages. Our technique outperforms two out of the three methods we compared against and is on a par to the best of those methods, but it needs significantly less time for prediction and training.",

Barber & Soohyoung Rain Lee,Gerontology,,August 2015,http://www.cognitionaginglab.com/uploads/4/3/6/5/43652835/barber_lee_inpress.pdf,"Background: Although stereotype threat is a well-documented phenomenon, previous studies examining it in older adults have almost exclusively focused on objective cognitive outcomes. Considerably less attention has been paid to the impact of stereotype threat on older adults’ subjective assessments of their own abilities or to the impact of stereotype threat in noncognitive domains. Objective: Older adults are stereotyped as having experienced not only cognitive declines, but physical declines as well. The current study tested the prediction that stereotype threat can negatively influence older adult’s subjective hearing abilities. Methods: To test this, 115 adults (M age = 50.02, range = 41-67) read either a positive or negative description about how aging affects hearing. All participants then answered a questionnaire in which they assessed their own hearing abilities. Results: The impact of stereotype threat on self-reported hearing was moderated by chronological age. Participants in their 40’s and early 50’s were unaffected by the stereotype threat manipulation. In contrast, participants in their late 50’s and 60’s rated their hearing as being subjectively worse when under stereotype threat. Conclusion: The current study provides a clear demonstration that stereotype threat negatively impacts older adults’ subjective assessments of their own abilities. It is also the first study to demonstrate an effect of stereotype threat within the domain of hearing. These results have important implications for researchers investigating age-related hearing decline. Stereotype threat can lead to overestimation of the prevalence of age-related hearing decline. It can also serve as a confounding variable when examining the psychosocial correlates of hearing loss. Because of this, researchers studying age-related hearing loss should aim to provide a stereotype threat free testing environment and also include assessments of stereotype threat within their studies.",

It has been previously suggested that certain personality factors, including individual differences in empathy, may be related to the pursuit of differing mating strategies. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationships between different forms of empathy and the inclination towards pursuing a short-term mating strategy, as indexed by sociosexuality. It was found that cognitive empathy abilities were positively associated with higher levels of sociosexuality, though much more so for individuals who were also high in affective empathy. When examining the various sub-components that make up sociosexuality, it was found this effect may be driven by the desire aspect of sociosexuality. It appears, therefore, that the ability to cognitively understand the emotional state of other individuals is related to promiscuous mating strategies, especially when combined with the ability to intuitively feel the emotions of the other individual.",

Results show that perceived pleasure and cost served as important predictors of online video sharing attitudes among college students and general consumers. Their intent to share online videos was predicted by perceived pleasure and normative influences, attitudes, and social media use. The number of online videos they shared was determined by online video consumption, intenteh, normative influences, and social media use. Sharing of online videos is different from sharing other online content in that perceived utilities and behavioral control do not really matter.

We present a new instrument composed of behaviors identified in previous analyses as having the highest impact on residential energy consumption. Our instrument allows for the specific measurement of self-reported behaviors, behavioral intentions, and inability to perform behaviors. Results from a convenience sample of 1522 U.S. adults demonstrate the construct validity of this instrument, as key factors known to influence pro-environmental behaviors—e.g., key environmental beliefs and attitudes—predict household energy efficiency behaviors.",

Theory and past research suggests filial obligation (FO) may mediate the relationship between attachment and caregiver preparedness. The goal of this study was to test that hypothesis. Method: The sample, collected using Mechanical Turk, included 165 women between the ages of 45 and 65 years who were not providing care to an aging parent. Participants were reimbursed $0.75 for completing an online survey assessing response validity, dimensions of adult attachment, depressive symptomatology, FO, and caregiver preparedness, among other variables. The mean participant age was 52.2 years (SD = 5.5). Results: The sample was predominantly White/Caucasian (82.6%), and Black/African American (7.3%). With respect to education, 14.5% completed high school or general education development (GED), 32.7% completed some college, 36.4% completed a Bachelor's degree, and 15.7% completed graduate degrees. The three attachment dimensions (close, dependent, and anxious) and FO were all significantly inner-correlated. Stepwise multiple regression analyses found that FO fully mediates the relationship between close attachment and caregiver preparedness, even after controlling for age, education, income, depression, and birth order. Conclusion: The primary finding is that FO mediates the relationship between close attachment style and caregiver preparedness among prospective caregivers. This suggests that individual differences in attachment style among prospective caregivers indirectly predict preparedness for future caregiving through FO, suggesting a mechanism relating attachment style and preparation for future care.",

In the first two samples, exploratory factor analysis reduced the original 30 item scale to a shorter, more parsimonious, eight item measure. In the third sample, confirmatory factor analysis found that the proposed model and items fit the data extremely well. Examination of the nomological network underlying the new measure in Samples 3–4 displayed relationships with positive affect, negative affect, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism ranging from r = .23 to − .23, while relationships with anger, hostility, physical aggression, and verbal aggression ranged from r = .49 to .30. Finally, in two criterion-related validity studies the relationships between the aggressive beliefs and attitudes scales, both original and short forms, and workplace deviance were examined with independent samples of employed adults. The short form scale was significantly related to workplace deviance in both samples (r = .37 and .43). Furthermore, these relationships were of identical magnitude to the full 30 item measure, suggesting that the short form scale comparably captures aggression-related behaviors with a greatly reduced number of items.",

Gerend",Neuroethics,,August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-015-9239-2/fulltext.html,"Two experiments investigated whether moral evaluations of organ transplantation influence judgments of death and causation. Participants’ beliefs about whether an unconscious organ donor was dead and whether organ removal caused death in a hypothetical vignette varied depending on the moral valence of the vignette. Those who were randomly assigned to the good condition (vs. bad) were more likely to believe that the donor was dead prior to organ removal and that organ removal did not cause death. Furthermore, attitudes toward euthanasia and organ donation independently predicted judgments of death and causation, regardless of experimental condition. The results are discussed in light of the framework of motivated reasoning, in which motivation influences the selection of cognitive processes and representations applied to a given domain, as well as Knobe’s person-as-moralist model, in which many basic concepts are appropriately imbued with moral features. On either explanatory framework, these data cast doubt on the psychological legitimacy of the mainstream justification for vital organ procurement from heart-beating donors, which holds that neurological criteria for death are scientifically justified, independently of concerns about organ transplantation. These data suggest that, rather than concluding that organ removal is permissible because the donor is dead, people may believe that the donor is dead because they believe organ removal to be permissible.",

Deacon",Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry,,March 2016,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791615300185,"Although client preferences are an integral component of evidence-based practice in psychology (American Psychological Association, 2006), relatively little research has examined what potential mental health consumers value in the psychotherapy they may receive. The present study was conducted to examine community members' preferences for the scientific and relational aspects of psychotherapy for different types of presenting problems, and how accurately therapists perceive these preferences. Community members (n = 200) were surveyed about the importance of scientific (e.g., demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials) and relational (e.g., therapist empathy) characteristics of psychotherapy both for anxiety disorders (e.g., obsessive–compulsive disorder) and disorder-nonspecific issues (e.g., relationship difficulties). Therapists (n = 199) completed the same survey and responded how they expected the average mental health consumer would. Results showed that although community members valued relational characteristics significantly more than scientific characteristics, the gap between these two was large for disorder-nonspecific issues (d = 1.24) but small for anxiety disorders (d = .27). Community members rated scientific credibility as important across problem types. Therapists significantly underestimated the importance of scientific characteristics to community members, particularly in the treatment of disorder-nonspecific issues (d = .74). Therapists who valued research less in their own practice were more likely to underestimate the importance of scientific credibility to community members. The implications of the present findings for understanding the nature of client preferences in evidence-based psychological practice are discussed.",

A major contributor of false positives is the practice of reporting a subset of the potentially relevant statistical analyses pertaining to a research project. This study is the first to provide direct evidence of selective underreporting in psychology experiments. To overcome the problem that the complete experimental design and full set of measured variables are not accessible for most published research, we identify a population of published psychology experiments from a competitive grant program for which questionnaires and data are made publicly available because of an institutional rule. We find that about 40% of studies fail to fully report all experimental conditions and about 70% of studies do not report all outcome variables included in the questionnaire. Reported effect sizes are about twice as large as unreported effect sizes and are about 3 times more likely to be statistically significant.",

For its part, MMORPG community involvement was a positive predictor of self-reported learning in both focused and incidental forms. Supplementary analyses suggested that self-efficacy was a comparatively more robust predictor of MMORPG community involvement when compared to self-construal. Moreover, the present data suggest that community involvement significantly facilitated indirect relationships between self-construal, game-relevant self-efficacy, and both focused and incidental learning.",

Yet, empirical research on the value that volunteers might provide to recipients of their support (i.e., clients) is very limited. Building on insights from attribution theory, we argue that clients are more likely to attribute support from volunteers to altruistic and sincere motives relative to support from paid workers, and that this provides the foundations for affect-based trust to develop between clients and volunteers. We present data from two experiments that support this indirect effect of volunteerism on affect-based trust. Our findings provide insights into why and how volunteers may provide relational value to clients and human service organizations.",

The term was coined before the turn of the century and the tabulation of the 2000 census. However, this term may be antiquated--not because African Americans no longer have disparate consumer experiences, but because these experiences impact all American minorities. This study examines the prevalence of racially motivated discriminatory experiences across consumer contexts. Specifically, it offers an empirical look at ways that racial minorities believe they are treated in a variety of consumption environments. Results show that minority groups experience similar levels of perceived discrimination: Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans are as frequently victims of marketplace discrimination as are African Americans. Interestingly, these shared experiences do not necessarily translate into similar beliefs in the continued existence of discrimination as a derogatory force for American minority consumers.",

Politicians use it to mock and dismiss allegations against them, while philosophers and political scientists warn that it could be used as a rhetorical weapon to pathologize dissent. In two empirical studies conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, I present an initial examination of whether this concern is justified. In Experiment 1, 150 participants judged a list of historical and speculative theories to be no less likely when they were labeled “conspiracy theories” than when they were labeled “ideas.” In Experiment 2 (N = 802), participants who read a news article about fictitious “corruption allegations” endorsed those allegations no more than participants who saw them labeled “conspiracy theories.” The lack of an effect of the conspiracy-theory label in both experiments was unexpected and may be due to a romanticized image of conspiracy theories in popular media or a dilution of the term to include mundane speculation regarding corruption and political intrigue.",

For this, participants were visually presented with two dishes, each containing the same ingredients arranged in either a linear or circular presentation. The influence of different naming strategies on people’s expectations concerning the dish was also assessed, as well as people’s preferred position of the tested linear vs. circular food arrangement. Results: The results highlight the importance of both visual presentation and naming on people’s response (e.g. in terms of their willingness to pay) for a commercial dish. That is, participants’ ratings favoured the linear over the circular arrangement of the same ingredients. Furthermore, the participants tilted the linear dish, when asked to position it such that it appeals to them most, such that the dominant element displayed an oblique line ascending to the right. Conclusions: The results reported here provide intriguing first evidence concerning a putative preference for an oblique line ascending to the right with respect to the appreciation of the food on a plate. The implications of this kind of research for chefs and restaurateurs are discussed. We also contrast these preliminary results with findings demonstrating people’s preference for horizontal/vertical lines (over oblique lines) in other aesthetic-related fields, such as painting.",

One recent effort to improve the obesogenic environment is mandating that restaurants provide calorie and other nutritional content on menus. Little is known about whether maternal feeding for young children is influenced by calorie disclosure on menus. This study examined (1) whether maternal feeding goals associate with mothers' food selections for their young children and (2) whether mothers change entrée and side selections for their children when calories/fat grams are listed on menus. Methods: One-hundred seventy mothers of children ages of 3–6 years participated in an online survey. Most participants identified as white (76.5%), with a mean BMI of 25.68 (standard deviation=5.94). Mothers were presented two menus (one with and one without calorie/fat information). Results: The goal of feeding for the child's familiarity with the food was significantly associated with mothers' selection of original side dish and entrées, with greater endorsement of this goal associated with choosing high-calorie/-fat sides and entrées. Feeding for natural content was associated with mothers' selection of original entrée, with greater endorsement of this goal associated with choosing low-calorie/-fat entrées. Significantly fewer mothers chose a higher-calorie entrée when there was menu labeling. Conclusions: Maternal feeding goals are associated with mothers' selection of entrée and side dishes on restaurant menus. Results from this study suggest that menu labeling of calories and fat grams may influence entrée choices by mothers. Targeting mothers' feeding goals and labeling restaurant menus may improve the diets of young children.",

Ryan",Journal of Personality,,September 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12215/abstract,"Pro-social behaviors have been associated with enhanced well-being, but what psychological mechanisms explain this connection? Some theories suggest that beneficence—the sense of being able to give—inherently improves well-being, whereas evidence from self-determination theory (Weinstein & Ryan, 2010) shows that increases in well-being are mediated by satisfaction of innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Here we simultaneously assess these two explanations. Study 1 (N = 335) used a cross-sectional survey with an Internet sample to develop a measure to assess beneficence satisfaction. The next two cross-sectional Internet-sample studies tested mediators between pro-social behavior and general well-being (Study 2, N = 332) and situational peak moment well-being (Study 3, N = 180). A fourth study (N = 85) used a diary method with university students to assess daily fluctuations in well-being associated with needs and beneficence. It was shown across all studies that both the three psychological needs and beneficence satisfaction mediate the relations between pro-social actions and well-being, with all four factors emerging as independent predictors. Together, these studies underscore the role of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in explaining the well-being benefits of benevolence, and they also point to the independent role of beneficence as a source of human wellness.",
Psych,,,,695,Assessing the family dynamics of childhood maltreatment history with the Childhood Attachment and Relational Trauma Screen (CARTS),"Frewen P, Brown M, DePierro J",European Journal of Psychotraumatology,,August 2015,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26243548,"BACKGROUND: Existing survey measures of childhood trauma history generally fail to take into account the relational-socioecological environment in which childhood maltreatment occurs. Variables such as the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, the emotional availability of caregivers, witnessing the abuse of others, and the respondent's own thoughts, feelings, and actions in response to maltreatment are rarely assessed by current measures. METHODS: To address these concerns, the current study further investigated the family dynamics of childhood maltreatment using the Childhood Attachment and Relational Trauma Screen (CARTS) in 1,782 persons assessed online. RESULTS: Paired differences in means between item-rated descriptiveness of self, mothers, and fathers suggested that respondents' relationship with their biological fathers was less positive and secure than their relationship with their biological mothers, and that biological fathers were more often the perpetrator of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse than biological mothers. However, results further suggested that ratings between self, mothers, and fathers were positively correlated such that, for example, reports of a mother's or a respondent's own abusive behavior were more likely in the presence of reports of a father's abusive behavior. In addition, analyses evaluating witnessing violence demonstrated that fathers were rated as more often violent toward mothers than the reverse, although intimate partner violence was also frequently bidirectional. Analyses of sibling ratings further demonstrated that older brothers were either as or more frequently abusive when compared with parents. Finally, results suggested that childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse were much more often perpetrated by family members than extra-familial and non-family members. CONCLUSIONS: In so far as these findings are consistent with the prior childhood trauma and attachment literature, the current study further supports the utility of the CARTS as a means of assessing the family dynamics of childhood attachment and maltreatment within a relational-socioecological framework.",42589

Marsh",Cogntion,,November 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715300421,"Research suggests that expertise in a specific category domain influences categorization. Work related to beliefs about mental disorders finds that laypeople treat mental disorders as if they do have causal essences, while clinicians do not—differences that may be attributable to expertise (Ahn, Flanagan, Marsh, & Sanislow, 2006). To test whether reduced beliefs in essences are indicative of an overall influence of expertise or a demonstration of a phenomenon specific to expertise in the mental health domain we compared beliefs about mental and medical disorders held by practicing physicians (n = 43; 19 primary care and 24 non-psychiatry specialists) and laypeople (n = 40). We found differences between these groups in beliefs held concerning the necessity of removing shared category features to effectively cure disorders. While laypeople endorsed the idea that the cause needed to be removed to cure both mental and medical disorders, this endorsement decreased with expertise. Primary care providers were less willing to endorse this for mental disorders than for medical disorders. Our results support the notion that the reduction of beliefs concerning the existence of essences is a unique effect of expertise in the mental health domain, and does not extend to other areas of expertise. In physicians, this reduction of essentialist beliefs was most evident in questions regarding treatment. Similarities and differences to the results from Ahn et al. (2006) are discussed.",

Fit theorists believe that passion for work is achieved through finding the right fit with a line of work; develop theorists believe that passion is cultivated over time. Four studies examined the expectations, priorities, and outcomes that characterize these implicit theories. Our results show that these beliefs elicit different motivational patterns, but both can facilitate vocational well-being and success. This research extends implicit theory scholarship to the work domain and provides a framework that can fruitfully inform career advising, life coaching, mentorship, and employment policies.",42587

Goodman",Cognitive Science,,July 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12269/full,"Humor plays an essential role in human interactions. Precisely what makes something funny, however, remains elusive. While research on natural language understanding has made significant advancements in recent years, there has been little direct integration of humor research with computational models of language understanding. In this paper, we propose two information-theoretic measures—ambiguity and distinctiveness—derived from a simple model of sentence processing. We test these measures on a set of puns and regular sentences and show that they correlate significantly with human judgments of funniness. Moreover, within a set of puns, the distinctiveness measure distinguishes exceptionally funny puns from mediocre ones. Our work is the first, to our knowledge, to integrate a computational model of general language understanding and humor theory to quantitatively predict humor at a fine-grained level. We present it as an example of a framework for applying models of language processing to understand higher level linguistic and cognitive phenomena.",

Maeder",Journal of Interpersonal Violence,,July 2015,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260515596976,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of cultural evidence toward an automatism defense, and whether such evidence would be detrimental or beneficial to a male versus a female defendant. U.S. participants (N = 208), recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, read a fictional spousal homicide case in which the defendant claimed to have blacked out during the crime. We manipulated the gender of the defendant and whether a culture-specific issue was claimed to have precipitated the defendant’s blackout. ANOVAs revealed that cultural evidence positively affected perceived credibility for the female defendant, whereas there were no differences for the male defendant. Results also demonstrated that when cultural evidence was presented, the female defendant was seen as less in control of her actions than was the male defendant. Furthermore, lower credibility and higher perceived defendant control predicted harsher verdict decisions. This investigation may aid scholars in discussing concerns regarding a clash between multicultural and feminist objectives in the courtroom.",

Rubina, Sinue Salgado",Consciousness and Cognition,,November 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810015300106,"We introduce a new scale, the Involuntary Autobiographical Memory Inventory (IAMI), for measuring the frequency of involuntary autobiographical memories and involuntary future thoughts. Using the scale in relation to other psychometric and demographic measures provided three important, novel findings. First, the frequency of involuntary and voluntary memories and future thoughts are similarly related to general measures of emotional distress. This challenges the idea that the involuntary mode is uniquely associated with emotional distress. Second, the frequency of involuntary autobiographical remembering does not decline with age, whereas measures of daydreaming, suppression of unwanted thoughts and dissociative experiences all do. Thus, involuntary autobiographical remembering relates differently to aging than daydreaming and other forms of spontaneous and uncontrollable thoughts. Third, unlike involuntary autobiographical remembering, the frequency of future thoughts does decrease with age. This finding underscores the need for examining past and future mental time travel in relation to aging and life span development.",

Our studies show that stereotypes about Christians being less competent in science than other groups are recognized by both Christians and non-Christians and are openly endorsed by non-Christians (Study 1). Our studies further demonstrate that when these stereotypes become salient, Christians are less interested in and identified with science (Study 2) and underperform on science-relevant tasks (Studies 3–5), compared to non-Christians. Even subtle contextual cues that bear more or less relevance to science are sufficient to compromise Christians’ scientific task performance, particularly among the highly religious (Study 5). When these stereotypes are explicitly removed, however, performance differences between Christians and non-Christians disappear. These results suggest that Christians’ awareness of the negative societal stereotypes about their group’s scientific competence may be partially responsible for the underperformance and underrepresentation of Christians in scientific fields.",

Method: 429 American adults from Amazon's Mechanical Turk who had a child under age three completed online questionnaires regarding their experiences trying to conceive, including recollections of psychological adjustment, use of coping strategies, and individual and situational variability. Then they provided open-ended reflections of their experience trying to conceive. Participants' descriptions were analyzed for word use using LIWC, a text-analysis software program, to obtain an unobtrusive and pseudo-observational measure of coping resources. Results: Consistent with the uncertainty navigation model, recollections of distress as individuals tried to conceive were associated with lower levels of dispositional optimism; intolerance of uncertainty; fewer social, emotional, and cognitive resources (reflected in word use); placing greater importance on conception; lower risk for infertility; and less searching for meaning in life. Conclusions: This study revealed many novel insights regarding the experience of trying to conceive, including protective factors and vulnerabilities that may buffer or heighten the distress associated with this experience.",

Additionally, a social consensus intervention was used to try to change mothers' likelihood to serve healthy foods. Methods: Mothers saw photographs of healthy and unhealthy snacks and meals and rated them on several factors that were hypothesized to predict the likelihood of serving the foods. Then, mothers were randomly assigned to the experimental or control condition. Those in the experimental condition received social consensus information about these foods, whereas the control condition did not. The change in perceptions in the control and experimental conditions was examined. Results: Mothers rated healthy meals and snacks less favourably than unhealthy meals and snacks on factors including cost, preparation time and difficulty, and child preference. Furthermore, mothers' perceptions of foods as liked by their child, easy to prepare and ‘kid-friendly’ predicted higher likelihood to serve those foods. Finally, mothers were more likely to describe the healthy snack as kid-friendly and indicated being more likely to serve it after receiving favourable social norm information about the food. Conclusions: The use of social consensus interventions to change parents' perceptions of healthy snacks may be one means of increasing the quality of children's diets.",

We utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing service, to investigate thermostat settings and behavior in households. We posted a survey and paid respondents to upload pictures of their thermostats to verify self-reported data. About 40% of programmable thermostat owners did not use programming features and 33% had programming features overridden. Respondents demonstrated numerous misconceptions about how thermostats control home energy use. Moreover, we found that 57% of households were occupied nearly all the time, limiting the potential energy savings. The study revealed flaws in selfreported data, when collected solely from traditional surveys, which raises concerns about the validity of current thermostat-related research using such data. “Ground truth” temperature data could now be available in homes with Internet-connected thermostats. Online crowdsourcing platforms emerge as valuable tools for collecting information that would be difficult or expensive to obtain through other means. Advantages over traditional surveys include low-cost, rapid design–implementation–result cycle, access to diverse population, use of multimedia. Crowdsourcing is more effective than alternative online tools due to easier recruitment process and respondents’ reputation system.",

The high rates of comorbidity among these conditions merit evaluation in order to improve diagnosis and treatment approaches. The current study evaluated the association between PTSD, MDD, and GAD factors as presented in the DSM 5. 602 trauma-exposed individuals who experienced an event that met Criterion A for the DSM 5 PTSD diagnosis were recruited through Amazon.com, Inc.'s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to complete an assessment of the impact of stressful events on their lives. High interrelations were detected among the 4 PTSD factors, 2 MDD factors that corresponded to somatic and affective symptoms, and the single GAD factor. The affective factor of MDD was most strongly related to the emotional numbing factor of PTSD, whereas the somatic factor of MDD was most strongly related to the hyperarousal factor of PTSD. The GAD factor was most strongly related to the hyperarousal factor of PTSD, relative to the other PTSD factors. The strength of the interrelations between factors of the three disorders is largely a function of the overlap in symptoms and calls into question the uniqueness of negative affective symptoms of PTSD, MDD and GAD. Results suggest that improved understanding of the trauma reaction requires a focus on the unique presentation of each individual and assessment of multiple disorders.",

In addition, this research examined the circumstances under which surprise rewards should be offered in order to yield maximum benefits for hospitality firms. In particular, the study examined how the customer's cumulative satisfaction (high vs. low) influences the effectiveness of surprise rewards (vs. membership discount rewards) in increasing customer delight and satisfaction and decreasing customer frustration. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, results show that surprise rewards are more effective than membership discount rewards for enhancing customer delight and satisfaction and attenuating customer frustration, particularly when the customer's cumulative satisfaction is low. These findings have important implications for the hospitality industry. Hospitality managers and marketers could use this information to design effective loyalty reward programs.",

In Experiment 1, participants (n = 305) rotated one of the visual elements on commercial examples of product packaging (three examples taken from the dried pasta category and one from the wine aisle). In Experiment 2, we assessed how much participants (n = 301) would be willing to pay for stimuli oriented in a more versus less preferred orientation. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that participants have distinct, systematic, preferences when it comes to the orientation that specific stimuli should be presented at on product packaging. In certain cases, multiple preferences were observed in the data, while in others, the participants tended to agree on a single preferred orientation. Interestingly, these preferences do not always align with the orientation of the image as it currently appears on the supermarket shelf. Intriguingly, in Experiment 2, the preferred orientation did not always elicit the highest willingness to pay. These results therefore highlight the complex relationship that exists between liking and willingness to pay, and raise a number of questions concerning the role of orientation in visual aesthetics, preference, and perceived value. Importantly, the orientation task is presented here as a potentially helpful new tool for assessing visual aesthetics and preference for product packaging.",

Given that appearing powerful may lead to actual power, those interested in achieving powerful positions may benefit from using abstract speech. In the current research, we propose that concrete speech may also have comparable benefits. Specifically, we argue that while abstract thinking is required to set big goals and make high level plans, concrete thinking is required to follow plans and achieve goals. Thus, whereas abstract speech signals the ability to think at a high level, concrete speech signals action orientation. Across four experiments, we find strong evidence for a link between concrete thinking and perceptions of action orientation. Importantly, we find that both power and action orientation are important predictors of preferences for leadership positions.",42582

Hence, the authors predicted that money primes would boost system justification, social dominance, belief in a just world, and free market ideology, and found supportive evidence. Rohrer, Pashler, and Harris (2015) failed to replicate those effects. This article discusses the factors that predict priming effects, and particularly those pertinent to differences between Caruso et al. and Rohrer et al. Variations in a prime's meaning, the ease with which primed content comes to mind, the prime's motivational importance, and the ambiguity of the outcome situation influence the impact of the prime. Money priming experiments (totaling 165 to date, from 18 countries) point to at least 2 major effects. First, compared to neutral primes, people reminded of money are less interpersonally attuned. They are not prosocial, caring, or warm. They eschew interdependence. Second, people reminded of money shift into professional, business, and work mentality. They exert effort on challenging tasks, demonstrate good performance, and feel efficacious. Money priming is not the same as priming another popular means of exchange, credit cards, and can have bigger effects when there is an implied connection between the self and having money. The practical benefits of money have been studied by other disciplines for decades, and the time is now for psychologists to study the effects of merely being reminded of money.

Twitter is of particular interest for public health surveillance because of its public nature. However, the very public nature of social media platforms such as Twitter may act as a barrier to public health surveillance, as people may be reluctant to publicly disclose information about their health. This is of particular concern in the context of diseases that are associated with a certain degree of stigma, such as HIV/AIDS. Objective: The objective of the study is to assess whether adverse effects of HIV drug treatment and associated sentiments can be determined using publicly available data from social media. Methods: We describe a combined approach of machine learning and crowdsourced human assessment to identify adverse effects of HIV drug treatment solely on individual reports posted publicly on Twitter. Starting from a large dataset of 40 million tweets collected over three years, we identify a very small subset (1642; 0.004%) of individual reports describing personal experiences with HIV drug treatment. Results: Despite the small size of the extracted final dataset, the summary representation of adverse effects attributed to specific drugs, or drug combinations, accurately captures well-recognized toxicities. In addition, the data allowed us to discriminate across specific drug compounds, to identify preferred drugs over time, and to capture novel events such as the availability of preexposure prophylaxis. Conclusions: The effect of limited data sharing due to the public nature of the data can be partially offset by the large number of people sharing data in the first place, an observation that may play a key role in digital epidemiology in general.",

Composite trauma and mental health diagnosis were significantly predictive of an NSSI history. The pathway between NSSI and gender was not significant. It is important to consider multiple domains of trauma, in the form of composite lifetime trauma, as risk factors for NSSI.",

We later learned that Caruso et al. also found several null effects in their line of research that were not reported in the original article.

Flusberg",Social Science & Medicine,,September 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615300393,"In 2013, the American Medical Association made the controversial decision to classify obesity as a “disease” in the hopes of encouraging research, reducing stigma, and ultimately lowering the prevalence of the condition. Critics argued that the disease label would reduce feelings of personal responsibility among the obese and therefore discourage healthy self-regulation, a possibility that has received some recent support in the psychological literature. However, public health issues such as obesity are complex and depend not only on personal action, but also on wider societal trends such as social policy interventions. In the present study, we systematically investigated the relationship between four narrative classifications of obesity (“sin”, “addiction”, “disorder” and “environment”) and support for a variety of policy interventions designed to address the issue. An initial norming study revealed that the obesity narratives differed reliably in how much they attributed blame for the condition to the individual versus the environment. A correlational study showed that participants who agreed with narratives that blamed the individual were more likely to support policy interventions that penalized people for being overweight while participants who agreed with narratives that blamed the environment were more likely to support policy interventions designed to protect people suffering from obesity. A follow-up experiment revealed that these narratives had causal power as well: participants exposed to just one of the narratives were more likely to support policy interventions consistent with the blame attribution of the narrative for both obesity as well as anorexia. Individual differences in political ideology and personal experience with weight issues also influenced agreement with the narratives and support for particular policy interventions across these studies. These findings suggest that public messaging campaigns that utilize extended narratives may be a useful tool for increasing support for effective policy interventions.",

Study 2 ruled out the alternative explanation that conflict reduces the tendency to overestimate outgroup dissimilarity through diminishing effortful thought. Study 3 showed that a conflict mindset, but not an accuracy incentive, reduced the tendency to overestimate outgroup dissimilarity. Additionally, Study 3 demonstrated that reductions in perceived self–outgroup distance explained in part why a conflict mindset attenuated the overestimation of outgroup dissimilarity.

In prior research, exposure to such metaphoric messages influences attitudes. The current research tests the novel possibility that metaphor exposure can elicit defensive avoidance of otherwise benign information. We build on the evidence that individuals with avoidant attachment style avoid thinking about close relationships, operationalized as lower recall of relationship information. Two studies show that dispositionally high and experimentally increased attachment avoidance impaired recall of messages framing political topics metaphorically in terms of close relationships. This effect is specific to the relationship metaphor and avoidance regarding relevant relationships. It held even when the message referred to positive relationships, casting doubt on an alternative valence priming explanation. Although the target political topics are not, literally speaking, close relationships, relationship-metaphoric messages led individuals who avoid relationship information to transfer that defensive processing style across domains.",

The present research proposes that gossip promotes cooperation when one anticipates future interdependence with the gossip recipient (Hypothesis 1), that this effect is more pronounced for proself, compared to prosocial, individuals (Hypothesis 2), and explores the mediating role of reputational concern and expected indirect benefits in the relation between gossip and cooperation. Results from three studies supported these hypotheses, showing that people are more generous in response to gossip to their future interaction partner(s), compared with gossip to other(s) they would never meet or no gossip. Moreover, proselfs, compared with prosocials, showed a larger increase in generosity when they anticipated future interactions with the gossip recipient(s). The observed gossip-based generosity was primarily mediated by reputational concern rather than expected indirect benefits from future partners, and the mediation of reputational concern was more pronounced for proselfs than for prosocials.",

Following development of an initial item pool, 505 participants (students at a large college in New York City and community members recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program) completed an online survey including a 20-item measure of microaggression behaviors. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three subscales: Assumption of Inferiority (α=0.81), Patronization (α=0.78), and Fear of Mental Illness (α=0.63). Additional analyses supported convergent validity of the measure with two widely used measures of mental illness stigma. The MIMS-P is the first instrument to measure microaggressions endorsed by perpetrators against a socially marginalized group and demonstrates strong psychometric properties.

Identifying the increasing number of ‘vape stores’ that specialise in selling ENDS can be challenging given the lack of regulatory policies and licensing. This study assesses the utility of online search methods in identifying ENDS vape stores. Methods We conducted online searches in Google Maps, Yelp, and YellowPages to identify listings of ENDS vape stores in Florida, and used a crowdsourcing platform to call and verify stores that primarily sold ENDS to consumers. We compared store listings generated from the online search and crowdsourcing methodology to list licensed tobacco and ENDS retailers from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation. Results The combined results from all three online sources yielded a total of 403 ENDS vape stores. Nearly 32.5% of these stores were on the state tobacco licensure list, while 67.5% were not. Accuracy of online results was highest for Yelp (77.6%), followed by YellowPages (77.1%) and Google (53.0%). Conclusions Using the online search methodology we identified more ENDS vape stores than were on the state tobacco licensure list. This approach may be a promising strategy to identify and track the growth of ENDS vape stores over time, especially in states without a systematic licensing requirement for such stores.",

A sample of 500 adults completed an online survey of sun protection belief items using Amazon Mechanical Turk. A two-phased cluster analysis (i.e., hierarchical and non-hierarchical K-means) was utilized to determine clusters of sun protection barriers and facilitators. Results yielded three distinct clusters of sun protection barriers and three distinct clusters of sun protection facilitators.

The underlying moral reasoning is often hard to extract from the public's rhetoric, and economists often claim that the objections are due to misunderstandings. In this paper we test experimentally one possible objection to trading emission rights: that selling pollution rights is objectionable because it involves trade in the right to do something wrong. The experiment is phrased in a neutral language to avoid invoking subjects’ prior attitudes to trading pollution permits. In the experiment, subjects earn money from using stickers that inflict losses on others. After the initial rounds, the use of stickers is limited and the rights to use stickers are tradable. We observe no reluctance to trade these rights compared to a control treatment with identical incentives but no externalities. In a final stage, subjects vote on whether stickers should be tradable or not. Subjects in both treatments are almost unanimous in the support to trade. A majority of third party subjects asked to judge the experimental procedures, however, indicated that the market made the use of stickers seem more moral. A post experiment survey showed that our subject pool had a negative attitude to real life trade of emission quota. The experiment finds no indication that this attitude is due to a concern over tradable quotas legitimizing morally objectionable actions.",

Bink, Annie Schmidt",Journal of Mental Health,,July 2015,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09638237.2015.1021902,"Background: The “Why Try” phenomenon, a consequence of self-stigma, is a sense of futility that occurs when people believe they are unworthy or incapable of achieving personal goals because they apply the stereotypes of mental illness to themselves. Aims: This study examines a four-stage model of self-stigma (aware, agree, apply, and self-stigma harm) and examines the “why try” effect as a result. We do that by testing a measure of “why try.” Method: Two hypothetical path models were tested. In the first, applying stereotypes to oneself leads to diminished self-respect and a sense of “why try”. In the second, the effect of applying stereotypes on “why try” is mediated by diminished self-respect. Participants completed the “why try” measure along with measures of self-stigma, public stigma, recovery, and empowerment. Results: Results show application of stereotypes to oneself predicts diminished self-respect and “why try”. “Why try” was significantly associated with agreement with public stigma, depression, and diminished sense of personal recovery. Conclusions: Findings from this study reveal the complex impact of self-stigma demonstrating its emotional and behavioral consequences. Implications for impacting self-stigma are discussed.",

In this paper we attempt to address a fundamental challenge in ubiquitous crowdsourcing: if people can contribute to crowdsourcing anytime and anyplace, why would they choose to do so? We highlight the role of motivation in ubiquitous crowdsourcing, and its effect on participation and performance. Through a series of field studies we empirically validate various motivational approaches in the context of ubiquitous crowdsourcing, and assess the comparable advantages of ubiquitous technologies' affordances. We show that through motivation ubiquitous crowdsourcing becomes comparable to online crowdsourcing in terms of participation and task performance, and that through motivation we can elicit better quality contributions and increased participation from workers. We also show that ubiquitous technologies' contextual capabilities can increase participation through increasing workers' intrinsic motivation, and that the in-situ nature of ubiquitous technologies can increase both participation and engagement of workers. Combined, our findings provide empirically validated recommendations on the design and implementation of ubiquitous crowdsourcing.",

One area where consumers are particularly prone to make costly decision-making errors is long-term saving, which requires understanding of complex concepts such as uncertainty and trade-offs. While most people are poorly equipped to deal with such concepts, interactive design can potentially help users make better decisions. We developed an interactive information label to assist consumers with retirement saving decision-making. To evaluate it, we exposed 382 users to one of three user interface conditions in a retirement saving simulator where they made 35 yearly decisions under changing circumstances. We found significantly better ability of users to reach their goals with the information label. Furthermore, users who interacted with the label made better decisions than those who were presented with a static information label. Lastly, we found the label particularly effective in helping novice savers.",

Here, we show that preferential attachment is equivalent to a form of ‘probability matching’ commonly found in studies of decision-making. This equivalence, whereby newcomers probability match to a social signal akin to popularity, marries network science to the study of decision-making and raises new questions about how individual psychology impacts the social structure of groups. We asked people to view a visualization of a social network and to select group members whom they would like to meet and befriend. People varied in how strongly they weighed popularity and this was mildly correlated with aspects of their personality. Individual differences in preferential attachment affect the structure and connectivity of the network that emerges.",42574

That said, few studies have examined how engagement in these impression management strategies varies across users. This paper presents initial findings from a large (N=833) study including three samples to evaluate the relationship between individual factors, network composition and privacy concerns with the use of social and technical features to regulate access to personal information on Facebook. Rather than a straightforward relationship between privacy concerns and impression management, findings suggest that engagement in these strategies involves a number of contextual factors such as age, sex, and Internet efficacy. These complex relationships are discussed with a focus on implications for researchers and designers to consider when evaluating and building these systems.",

Research has not established which neuropsychological mechanisms support lending decisions, nor whether their influence extends to markets involving significant financial incentives. In two studies, we found that neural affective mechanisms influence the success of requests for microloans. In a large Internet database of microloan requests (N = 13,500), we found that positive affective features of photographs promoted the success of those requests. We then established that neural activity (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens) and self-reported positive arousal in a neuroimaging sample (N = 28) predicted the success of loan requests on the Internet, above and beyond the effects of the neuroimaging sample’s own choices (i.e., to lend or not). These findings suggest that elicitation of positive arousal can promote the success of loan requests, both in the laboratory and on the Internet. They also highlight affective neuroscience’s potential to probe neuropsychological mechanisms that drive microlending, enhance the effectiveness of loan requests, and forecast market-level behavior.",

Sharing selfies on social media has become a popular activity, prompting questions about its psychological meaning and dispositionally-relevant motives. This study was performed to examine the association between narcissism, a personality trait characterized by inflated self-views and attempts to seek attention and admiration from others, and frequency of posting selfies on social networking sites. In addition, the association between posting selfies and three facets of narcissism (i.e., Leadership/Authority, Grandiose Exhibitionism, Entitlement/Exploitativeness) was explored. These questions were addressed in a nationally representative sample of 1204 men and women who completed an online survey. Results showed that narcissism, as well as the Leadership/Authority and Grandiose Exhibitionism facets, but not Entitlement/Exploitativeness, exhibited positive and significant associations with selfie-posting frequency. Age did not moderate the predictive effects of narcissism or any of its three dimensions, indicating that the relationship between narcissism, its facets, and posting selfies is not age dependent. However, the more adaptive Leadership/Authority facet emerged as a stronger predictor of selfie posting among women than men, whereas the maladaptive Entitlement/Exploitativeness facet predicted selfie posting among men, but not women. Interpretations and implications of these findings are discussed.",

Design/Methodology/Approach: Data were collected from two samples of non-student participants. Each participant evaluated the perceived hirability of an ostensibly real job applicant by reviewing the applicant’s resume. In reality, all participants were randomly assigned to evaluate the same fictitious resume that differed only in the gender and sexual orientation of the applicant. Findings: We find that men perceived gay and lesbian job applicants as less hirable, while women perceived gay and lesbian job applicants as more hirable than heterosexual job applicants. Additionally, we show perceptions of hirability are mediated by perceptions of gay and lesbian job applicants’ competence. Implications: These results show that bias against gays and lesbians is much more nuanced than previous work suggests. One implication is that placing more women in selection roles within organizations could be a catalyst for the inclusion of gay and lesbian employees. Additionally, these results could influence when and how gays and lesbians disclose their gay identities at work. Originality/Value: These studies are the first to identify a positive bias in favor of gay and lesbian job applicants. As attitudes toward gays and lesbians become more positive, results like these are important to document as they signal a shift in intergroup relations. These results will also help managers and organizations design selection processes to minimize bias toward applicants.",42572

Yet, the nature of this effect remains largely unknown, with lab experiments insisting that it is either positive or negative or null, and field experiments suggesting that it is instead curvilinear. Here we shed light on this apparent contradiction by considering a novel class of public goods games inspired to the realistic scenario in which the natural output limits of the public good imply that the benefit of cooperation increases fast for early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a large lab experiment providing evidence that, in this case, group size has a curvilinear effect on cooperation, according to which intermediate-size groups cooperate more than smaller groups and more than larger groups. In doing so, our findings help fill the gap between lab experiments and field experiments and suggest concrete ways to promote large scale cooperation among people.",

However, filtering interesting content from the large volume of messages received through Twitter places a significant cognitive burden on users. Motivated by this problem, we develop a new automated mechanism to detect personalised interestingness, and investigate this for Twitter. Instead of undertaking semantic content analysis and matching of tweets, our approach considers the human response to content, in terms of whether the content is sufficiently stimulating to get repeatedly chosen by users for forwarding (retweeting). This approach involves machine learning against features that are relevant to a particular user and their network, to obtain an expected level of retweeting for a user and a tweet. Tweets observed to be above this expected level are classified as interesting. We implement the approach in Twitter and evaluate it using comparative human tweet assessment in two forms: through aggregated assessment using Mechanical Turk, and through a web-based experiment for Twitter users. The results provide confidence that the approach is effective in identifying the more interesting tweets from a user’s timeline. This has important implications for reduction of cognitive burden: the results show that timelines can be considerably shortened while maintaining a high degree of confidence that more interesting tweets will be retained. In conclusion we discuss how the technique could be applied to mitigate possible filter bubble effects.",

However, creating campaigns to slow the emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens is challenging because the goal—antibiotic stewardship—encompasses multiple behaviors. This study provided a novel approach to audience segmentation for a multifaceted goal, by using a person-centered approach to identify profiles of U.S. adults based on shared stewardship intentions. The latent class analysis identified three groups: stewards, stockers, and demanders. The findings suggest campaigns with goals aimed at encouraging stewards to follow through on their intentions, encouraging stockers to dispose of their leftover antibiotics, and convincing demanders to accept providers' evidence-based judgment when a prescription for antibiotics is not indicated. Covariate analysis showed that people who held more inaccurate beliefs about what antibiotics can treat had higher odds of being demanders and stockers instead of stewards. People with stronger health mavenism also had higher odds of being stockers instead of stewards. The covariate analysis provided theoretical insight into the strategies to pursue in campaigns targeting these 3 groups.",

This has led to the use of a wide range of technologies (Internet, Databases, Web 2.0, etc.) to facilitate disclosure. However, since there is a huge cost of generating and maintaining open data, there also is a concern: “will anyone do anything with the data?” In a speech in 2009, David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, used the term “armchair auditor” to describe crowdsourcing analysis of that data. In that speech, Cameron (2009) noted: “Just imagine the effect that an army of armchair auditors is going to have on those expense claims.” Accordingly, as more and more countries and organizations generate open data, those “armchair auditors” could play an increasingly important role: to help crowdsource monitoring of government expenditures. This paper investigates a number of potential benefits and a number of emerging concerns associated with armchair auditors.",

This interference has been explained within various incremental learning accounts of word production, which propose that each attempt at mapping semantic features to lexical items induces slight but persistent changes that result in cumulative interference. We examined whether similar interference-generating mechanisms operate during the mapping of lexical items to segments by examining the production of words in the context of others that share segments. Previous research has shown that initial-segment overlap amongst a set of target words produces facilitation, not interference. However, this initial-segment facilitation is likely due to strategic preparation, an external factor that may mask underlying interference. In the present study, we applied a novel manipulation in which the segmental overlap across target items was distributed unpredictably across word positions, in order to reduce strategic response preparation. This manipulation led to interference in both spoken (Exp. 1) and written (Exp. 2) production. We suggest that these findings are consistent with a competitive learning mechanism that applies across stages and modalities of word production.",

Study 2 demonstrated that self-perceived knowledge within specific domains (e.g., biology) is associated specifically with overclaiming within those domains. In Study 3, warning participants that some of the concepts they saw were fictitious did not reduce the relationship between self-perceived knowledge and overclaiming, which suggests that this relationship is not driven by impression management. In Study 4, boosting self-perceived expertise in geography prompted assertions of familiarity with nonexistent places, which supports a causal role for self-perceived expertise in claiming impossible knowledge.",

Through a media preference survey, men then learned that their female partner disliked sexual content in films, after which they had an opportunity to send her up to 120 sec' worth of either a sexually explicit or nonsexual film clip. Validating the online sexual aggression paradigm, men with a 1-year history of sexual assault exhibited more sexually aggressive responding during the film selection paradigm. Moreover, exposure to injunctive norm information produced a boomerang effect, such that men high in hostile sexist attitudes showed an increase in sexual aggression when confronted with paternalism and gender equality norms. Conversely, exposure to paternalism and gender equality norms suppressed the otherwise protective function of high benevolent sexism in reducing men's sexually aggressive tendencies.

Stories that employees told about positive relationships at work revealed that relationships serve a broad range of functions, including the traditionally studied functions of task assistance, career advancement, and emotional support, as well as less studied functions of personal growth, friendship, and the opportunity to give to others. Building on this taxonomy, we validated a scale—the Relationship Functions Inventory—and developed theory suggesting differential linkages between the relationship functions and outcomes indicative of employee flourishing. Results revealed unique associations between functions and outcomes, such that task assistance was most strongly associated with job satisfaction, giving to others was most strongly associated with meaningful work, friendship was most strongly associated with positive emotions at work, and personal growth was most strongly associated with life satisfaction. Our results suggest that work relationships play a key role in promoting employee flourishing, and that examining the differential effects of a taxonomy of relationship functions brings precision to our understanding of how relationships impact individual flourishing.",

Using crowd-sourcing and student samples, we examined the relationship between the Dark Triad traits with different facets of dispositional aggression. Results indicated that a common Dark Triad factor (i.e., callousness and manipulation) predicted a common aggression factor. However, the individual Dark Triad traits uniquely predicted different facets of aggression. Psychopathy positively predicted physical aggression, narcissism negatively predicted hostility, and Machiavellianism positively predicted hostility. Taken together, the findings shed light on the unique elements of the Dark Triad and their ability to predict unique forms of dispositional aggression.",

Existing work in this area has focused on situations in which the target’s trustworthiness is relevant to the judgment (e.g., criminal verdicts and economic games). Yet in the present studies, we found that people also overgeneralized trustworthiness in criminal-sentencing decisions when trustworthiness should not be judicially relevant, and they did so even for the most extreme sentencing decision: condemning someone to death. In Study 1, we found that perceptions of untrustworthiness predicted death sentences (vs. life sentences) for convicted murderers in Florida (N = 742). Moreover, in Study 2, we found that the link between trustworthiness and the death sentence occurred even when participants viewed innocent people who had been exonerated after originally being sentenced to death. These results highlight the power of facial appearance to prejudice perceivers and affect life outcomes even to the point of execution, which suggests an alarming bias in the criminal-justice system.",

Drawing from precarious manhood theory, we hypothesize that when a woman occupies a superior organizational role, men in subordinate positions experience threat, which leads them to behave more assertively toward her and advocate for themselves.

In Study 3, we investigate a boundary condition to this effect and demonstrate that a woman in a superior role who displays qualities associated with administrative agency (e.g., directness, proactivity) rather than ambitious agency (e.g., self-promotion, power-seeking) elicits less assertive behavior from men.

In practice, LSEs are promoting various demand response (DR) programs to stimulate the flexibility of industrial and commercial demand. However, in the residential sector, due to customers’ versatile electricity consumption patterns, fully utilizing the responsive residential demand through DR programs such as incentive based demand response (I-DR) is difficult. Specifically, in I-DR, the most crucial issue for LSEs is how to estimate the residents’ potential responses to certain financial incentives. Therefore, this paper presents an approach which integrates three data sets (1. the residential energy consumption survey by the U.S. energy information administration; 2. the American time use survey by the U.S. Department of Labor; and 3. the survey of customers’ reactions to financial incentives in DR program by the center for ultra-wide-area resilient electric energy transmission networks) to assess responsive residential demand in a stochastic model. This proposed approach can be easily customized for any given times, locations, financial incentives, and residents’ portfolios. Also, it will help LSEs get the valuable insights on regulating the residential demand by adjusting the financial incentives to customers and improving the mechanism existing demand response programs.",

In an online survey, 689 participants recruited from a crowdsource website were queried about their anticipated health information seeking, perceived risk, and efficacy in response to four scenarios pertaining to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol dependence, and diabetes. Each participant was categorized for each scenario as responsive (higher risk, higher efficacy), avoidant (higher risk, lower efficacy), proactive (lower risk, higher efficacy), or indifferent (lower risk, lower efficacy). As predicted, responsive individuals were more likely to seek information than avoidant individuals, but only in three of the four scenarios. Also as expected, there was no difference between proactive and indifferent individuals’ likelihood of seeking health information for any scenario. Risk and efficacy, while significant predictors of anticipated health information seeking, left much of the variance unexplained. An analysis of the reasons for information seeking and nonseeking among nonconforming cases suggests that a wider range of influences on health information seeking should be investigated, including curiosity, prior knowledge, social expectations, and situational norms.",

We experimentally manipulated perceptions of labor market trends and asked participants to report on problems within their own actual organization. As predicted, an ostensibly weak external labor market led employees to perceive their organization as less inefficient (Study 1), identify fewer organizational efficiency problems (Study 2), downplay the impact of organizational inefficiencies (Study 3), and generate a greater ratio of pros to cons regarding how their organization is run (Study 4), compared to employees exposed to relatively favorable labor market information. Results suggest an enhanced motivation to deny the existence of organizational flaws when employment alternatives are perceived to be scarce.",

Therefore, several approaches exist for running network measurements, ranging from analyzing live traffic traces from campus or Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks to performing active measurements on distributed testbeds, e.g., PlanetLab, or involving volunteers. However, each method falls short, offering only a partial view of the network. For instance, the scope of passive traffic traces is limited to an ISP’s network and customers’ habits, whereas active measurements might be biased by the population or node location involved. To complement these techniques, we propose to use (commercial) crowdsourcing platforms for network measurements. They permit a controllable, diverse and realistic view of the Internet and provide better control than do measurements with voluntary participants. In this study, we compare crowdsourcing with traditional measurement techniques, describe possible pitfalls and limitations, and present best practices to overcome these issues. The contribution of this paper is a guideline for researchers to understand when and how to exploit crowdsourcing for network measurements.",

To date, no studies have examined passenger's attitudes toward the water reuse concepts at airports. 404 participants from India and the USA answered questions related to their attitudes toward various types of water reuse at airports. The results demonstrate that there are differences between cultures with respect to attitudes toward water reuse, and attitudes become more negative as degree of contact increases. Furthermore, the results indicate that there is a high correlation between participant scores from the commitment to environmental sustainability attitude scale and the attitude scores regarding type of water use.",42564

We examine this experimentally by contrasting the performance of native and non-native English speakers in a simple Wug-task, showing that non-native speakers are significantly more likely to provide non -ed (i.e., irregular) past-tense forms for novel verbs than native speakers. Both groups are sensitive to sound similarities between new words and existing words (i.e., are more likely to provide irregular forms for novel words which sound similar to existing irregulars). Among both natives and non-natives, irregularizations are non-random; that is, rather than presenting as truly irregular inflectional strategies, they follow identifiable sub-rules present in the highly frequent set of irregular English verbs. Our results shed new light on how native and non-native learners can affect language structure.",

Conformal prediction is the principled and unified adaptive and learning framework used to design, develop, and deploy a multi-faceted self-managing defensive shield to detect, disrupt, and deny intrusive attacks, hostile and malicious behavior, and subterfuge. Conformal prediction leverages apparent relationships between immunity and intrusion detection using non-conformity measures characteristic of affinity, a typicality, and surprise, to recognize patterns and messages as friend or foe and to respond to them accordingly. The solutions proffered throughout are built around active learning, meta-reasoning, randomness, distributed semantics and stratification, and most important and above all around adaptive Oracles. The motivation for using conformal prediction and its immediate off-spring, those of semi-supervised learning and transduction, comes from them first and foremost supporting discriminative and non-parametric methods characteristic of principled demarcation using cohorts and sensitivity analysis to hedge on the prediction outcomes including negative selection, on one side, and providing credibility and confidence indices that assist meta-reasoning and information fusion.",

Motivated by their ongoing success in various visual recognition tasks, we build our system upon a state-of-the-art convolutional network. We overcome its closed-set limitations by complementing the network with a series of one-vs-all classifiers that can learn to recognize new semantic classes online. Prior domain knowledge is incorporated by embedding the classification system into a Bayesian filter framework that also ensures temporal coherence. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the system on a robot that maps a variety of places on our campus in real-time. We show how semantic information can boost robotic object detection performance and how the semantic map can be used to modulate the robot’s behaviour during navigation tasks. The system is made available to the community as a ROS module.",

Bischof,Journal of the American Statistical Association,,July 2015,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2015.1051182,"An ongoing challenge in the analysis of document collections is how to summarize content in terms of a set of inferred themes that can be interpreted substantively in terms of topics. The current practice of parameterizing the themes in terms of most frequent words limits interpretability by ignoring the differential use of words across topics. Here, we show that words that are both frequent and exclusive to a theme are more effective at characterizing topical content, and we propose a regularization scheme that leads to better estimates of these quantities. We consider a supervised setting where professional editors have annotated documents to topic categories, organized into a tree, in which leaf-nodes correspond to more specific topics. Each document is annotated to multiple categories, at different levels of the tree. We introduce a hierarchical Poisson convolution model to analyze these annotated documents. A parallelized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler allows the inference to scale to millions of documents. The model leverages the structure among categories defined by professional editors to infer a clear semantic description for each topic in terms of words that are both frequent and exclusive. In this supervised setting, we validate the efficacy of word frequency and exclusivity at characterizing topical content on two very large collections of documents, from Reuters and the New York Times. In an unsupervised setting, we then consider a simplified version of the model that shares the same regularization scheme with the previous model. We carry out a large randomized experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to demonstrate that topic summaries based on frequency and exclusivity, estimated using the proposed regularization scheme, are more interpretable than currently established frequency-based summaries, and that the proposed model produces more efficient estimates of exclusivity than the currently established models.",

Here, we report on a laboratory experiment exploring how these findings transfer to a non-cooperative setting. We find two major results: (i) promoting intuition versus deliberation has no effect on cooperative behaviour among inexperienced subjects living in a non-cooperative setting; (ii) experienced subjects cooperate more than inexperienced subjects, but only under time pressure. These results suggest that cooperation is a learning process, rather than an instinctive impulse or a self-controlled choice, and that experience operates primarily via the channel of intuition. Our findings shed further light on the cognitive basis of human cooperative decision-making and provide further support for the recently proposed social heuristics hypothesis.",

It argues that contextual information may function as a precondition for the emergence of egocentric preferences. With a focus on the trade-off between using monetary policy for a domestic or an international goal, it presents evidence from three original American surveys using informative vignettes to show how monetary policy preferences exhibit firm-based egocentric variation: Individuals whose employer does most of its business in overseas markets have a lesser preference for domestic monetary autonomy. It also presents evidence from a survey experiment to show how the strength of this egocentric relationship depends on the informative power of the vignette: A more contextually informative vignette produces a stronger relationship between overseas business activity and a preference against domestic monetary autonomy.",

The sample consists of 170 women, aged 18–35 from across the US. In an online questionnaire, 34% of the sample reported using physical aggression against a partner. Primary reasons for engaging in aggression were “anger [73%]” and “temper [68%].” For those who were not aggressive, primary deterrents were beliefs that “using aggression is inappropriate [72%]” and “under no circumstances is physical aggression okay [71%].” Physically aggressive females were less satisfied with relationships, more accepting of physical violence, and felt more provoked in conflict situations. Across varied studies assessing reasons for physical aggression against a partner, anger is perceived as most prevalent, though a meta-analysis found that trait anger has a small association with intimate partner aggression. The strikingly different results indicate the need for research to reconcile this discrepancy.",

Researchers have distinguished between disgust propensity, defined as one's general tendency to experience disgust, and disgust sensitivity, defined as one's negative appraisal of the experience of disgust. Based upon speculations that disgust sensitivity may amplify the experience of disgust propensity on disgust-relevant outcomes, this study examined the interaction of disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity in relation to mental contamination among a community sample of adults located in the United States recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (N=478). The results suggest that disgust sensitivity potentiates the effect of disgust propensity on mental contamination. The interactive effect was robust to the effects of negative affect and broader contamination fears. These results indicate that mental contamination is particularly strong among individuals with concurrently high disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity.

Cacioppo",Cortex,,September 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215002221,"Being on the social perimeter is not only sad, it is dangerous. Our evolutionary model of the effects of perceived social isolation (loneliness) on the brain as well as a growing body of behavioral research suggests that loneliness promotes short-term self-preservation, including an increased implicit vigilance for social, in contrast to nonsocial, threats. However, this hypothesis has not been tested previously in a neuroimaging study. We therefore used high density EEG and a social Stroop interference task to test the hypothesis that implicit attention to negative social, in contrast to nonsocial, Words in the Stroop task differs between individuals high versus low in loneliness and to investigate the brain dynamics of implicit processing for negative social (vs nonsocial) stimuli in lonely individuals, compared to nonlonely individuals (N = 70). The present study provides the first evidence that negative social stimuli are differentiated from negative nonsocial stimuli more quickly in the lonely than nonlonely brains. Given the timing of this differentiation in the brain and the fact that participants were performing a Stroop task, these results also suggest that these differences reflect implicit rather than explicit attentional differences between lonely and nonlonely individuals. Source estimates were performed for purposes of hypothesis generation regarding underlying neural mechanisms, and the results implicated the neural circuits reminiscent of orienting and executive control aspects of attention as contributing to these differences. Together, the results are in accord with the evolutionary model of loneliness.",

Previous research (Tkach & Lyubomirsky, 2006) shows that there are eight general happiness-increasing strategies: social affiliation, partying, mental control, goal pursuit, passive leisure, active leisure, religion, and direct attempts. The present study investigates the factor structure of the happiness-increasing strategies scales (H-ISS) and their relationship to positive and negative affect. Method. The present study used participants’ (N = 1,050 and age mean = 34.21 sd = 12.73) responses to the H-ISS in structural equation modeling analyses. Affect was measured using the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule. Results. After small modifications we obtained a good model that contains the original eight factors/scales. Moreover, we found that women tend to use social affiliation, mental control, passive leisure, religion, and direct attempts more than men, while men preferred to engage in partying and clubbing more than women. The H-ISS explained significantly the variance of positive affect (R2 = .41) and the variance of negative affect (R2 = .27). Conclusions. Our study is an addition to previous research showing that the factor structure of the happiness-increasing strategies is valid and reliable. However, due to the model fitting issues that arise in the present study, we give some suggestions for improving the instrument.",

Participants were 615 parents (55 % female) and one of their 3–17 year old children (45 % female). Parents provided reports of their harsh and lax parenting tactics as well as offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regression analyses were utilized to examine the relations between the interaction of harsh and lax parenting on youth symptoms. The interaction between harsh and lax discipline was significantly related to youth internalizing, but not externalizing, problems in the both the young and middle childhood samples and marginally significant in the adolescence sample: seesaw discipline—a novel construct indicative of high levels of both harsh and lax discipline—was associated with the highest levels of youth internalizing problems. Parents who engage in seesaw parenting have children and adolescents who are more likely to evidence internalizing symptoms. Such findings may inform prevention and intervention efforts that target dysfunctional discipline.",

One explanation is that similar others are perceived to have preferences that are correlated with one’s own, and this makes their advice more diagnostic. The other is that similar others are liked more so people follow their advice to maintain connectedness with them. We propose a more general explanation, which incorporates the advice taker’s processing goals. In order to process any advice, advice takers activate a mentalizing goal, which is to understand the adviser’s mental states. Similarity creates a perception of such an understanding, and induces a feeling of certainty (i.e., a feeling of knowing), which validates the advice as a decision input, and increases persuasion. A mentalizing explanation accounts for the effect even when similarity cannot lead to perceptions of correlated preferences or to interpersonal liking. Four studies show that the effect attenuates if advice-takers are less likely to mentalize, are already primed to feel certain, or misattribute their feeling of certainty to a source other than the advice. Furthermore, the feeling of certainty emanating from similarity even influences decisions unrelated to the advice.",

May",International Journal of Cognitive Therapy,,,http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/ijct.2015.8.2.114,"Klonsky and May (2014) argued that an “ideation-to-action” framework should guide suicide theory, research, and prevention. From this perspective, (a) the development of suicide ideation and (b) the progression from ideation to suicide attempts are distinct processes with distinct explanations. The present article introduces a specific theory of suicide rooted in the ideation-to-action framework: the Three-Step Theory (3ST). First, the theory hypothesizes that suicide ideation results from the combination of pain (usually psychological pain) and hopelessness. Second, among those experiencing both pain and hopelessness, connectedness is a key protective factor against escalating ideation. Third, the theory views the progression from ideation to attempts as facilitated by dispositional, acquired, and practical contributors to the capacity to attempt suicide. To examine the theory, the authors administered self-report measures to 910 U.S. adults utilizing Amazon's Mechanical Turk (oversampling for ideation and attempt histories). Results supported the theory's central tenets. First, an interactive model of pain and hopelessness accounted for substantial variance in suicide ideation. This result replicated in both men and women, and across age groups (i.e., 18–25, 26–35, and 36–70). Also as predicted, connectedness was most protective against ideation in those high on both pain and hopelessness. Finally, dispositional, acquired, and practical aspects of suicide capacity each predicted suicide attempt history over and above current and lifetime suicidal ideation. These initial findings support the 3ST. Implications for suicide prevention and future research are discussed.",

Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions differentially activate two cortical networks associated with mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however, it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing ( why vs how ) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks. Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA, both across and within trials. This suggests that the human capacity to understand actions at different LOA is based in the relative activity of two cortical networks.",42552

The goal of the present research was to identify non-stigmatizing visual content for health education materials that can promote exercise among people of diverse weight statuses. An online sample of 483 US women viewed: (i) a woman with obesity portrayed stereotypically; (ii) a woman with obesity exercising; (iii) a woman with obesity portrayed neutrally; or (iv) a lean woman exercising. Race of the models pictured was randomized (White or Black). Participants completed measures of weight bias and exercise behavior and attitudes, and provided information about their weight status. Analysis of covariance revealed that responses to stereotypical and exercise images varied by participant weight status. Across participants, neutral obesity portrayals elicited lower expressions of weight-biased attitudes and higher reports of exercise liking/comfort. Among non-overweight participants, images portraying women with obesity stereotypically or counter-stereotypically produced greater endorsement of negative stereotypes than control, lean images. No effects of model race were found. These findings suggest that the public responds differently to visual portrayals of obesity depending on weight status, and neutral portrayals may be an effective route toward promoting exercise without perpetuating stigma.",

Magee",Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,,September 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597815000709,"Eight studies found a robust negative relationship between the experience of power and the experience of loneliness. Dispositional power and loneliness were negatively correlated (Study 1). Experimental inductions established causality: we manipulated high versus low power through autobiographical essays, assignment to positions, or control over resources, and found that each manipulation showed that high versus low power decreased loneliness (Studies 2a–2c). We also demonstrated both that low power can increase loneliness and that high power can decrease loneliness by comparing these conditions to a baseline condition (Studies 3–4, 6). Furthermore, we establish a key mechanism that explains this effect, demonstrating that the need to belong mediates the effect of power on loneliness (Studies 5–6). These findings help explain some effects of power on social cognition, offer insights into organizational well-being and motivation, and speak to the fundamental question of whether it is “lonely at the top” or lonelier at the bottom.",42550

Good emotional support (e.g. provided by an Intelligent Virtual Agent) could help relieve this stress. This study investigates whether adaptation to personality affects the amount and type of emotional support a carer is given and possible interaction effects with the stress experienced. We investigated the personality trait of Emotional Stability (ES) as it is interlinked with low tolerance for stress. Participants were presented with 7 stressful scenarios experienced by a fictitious carer and a description of their personality and asked to rank 6 emotional support messages. We predicted that people with low ES would be given more emotional support messages overall and that ES would affect the type of emotional support messages given in each scenario. We found that participants gave more praise to the high ES carer with a trend towards other support types for the low ES carer.,

We suggest that something as simple as asking for a report of units of work completed (for instance, reporting either the time spent or number of units of work completed) as opposed to the cost of the work completed can drive different unethical behaviors. We argue that unit-reporting makes providers feel accountable for their actions, and this induced accountability, in turn, impacts actual billing behaviors. We present seven studies, including a field experiment in the auto-repair industry that demonstrate the effect of different work-report formats on overbilling and provide evidence for our proposed underlying mechanism.",

We examine the veracity of this expectation empirically with an experiment that exposed individuals to information about endorsements of the terminology change made by the federal government, Special Olympics, or professional psychologists. We subsequently measured attitudes about persons with ID and the language used to describe ID. Results indicate that exposure to information about elite endorsement of the terminological shift either exacerbated negative attitudes or had no effect, suggesting that other factors may have primacy over “expert” opinion.",

Specifically, violent games improve many aspects of cognition and attention but can also increase aggression. Compared to these established effects of exposure to violent video games, very little is known about who plays violent video games and why they play them. Taking an evolutionary psychological approach to address this gap, in two studies we surveyed 1000 men and women who reported playing video games in the past 30 days. We assessed three classes of predictors of violent video game exposure: demographic, status-related, and mating-related. In both studies, women who played the most violent video games reported feeling a greater sense of mate value than women who played fewer violent video games. Women also reported being motivated to play violent video games because doing so enhanced their sense of attractiveness to romantic partners. In both studies, men reported playing more violent video games than women as did both men and women who reported higher sexual interest. These findings highlight the counterintuitive and complex motivations underlying violent video game exposure. We discuss the need for more research on who plays violent video games and why they play them.",

A possible mechanism underlying the effects of smiles is babyfacedness. Four studies were conducted with 1,235 participants. In Study 1, 646 participants were assigned to one of the six levels of smile intensity and responded to the measures of age perception and perceived babyfacedness. Compared to the neutral expression, the maximal smile reduced age estimations and this effect was mediated by perceived babyfacedness. In Study 2, 59 respondents' responses indicated that a maximal smile reduced the perception of age. In Study 3, 318 respondents estimated the age of models in different sex and levels of smile intensity. Maximal smiles reduced age estimations. In Study 4, 125 students and 87 non-students were randomly assigned to one of the three levels of smile intensity and provided age estimations. Replicating previous findings, maximal smiles reduced age estimations. Consistent results emerged from the various contexts, models, and samples, as well as in a pooled analysis.",

We utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing service, to investigate thermostat settings and behavior in households. We posted a survey and paid respondents to upload pictures of their thermostats to verify self-reported data. About 40% of programmable thermostat owners did not use programming features and 33% had programming features overridden. Respondents demonstrated numerous misconceptions about how thermostats control home energy use. Moreover, we found that 57% of households were occupied nearly all the time, limiting the potential energy savings. The study revealed flaws in self-reported data, when collected solely from traditional surveys, which raises concerns about the validity of current thermostat-related research using such data. “Ground truth” temperature data could now be available in homes with Internet-connected thermostats. Online crowdsourcing platforms emerge as valuable tools for collecting information that would be difficult or expensive to obtain through other means. Advantages over traditional surveys include low-cost, rapid design–implementation–result cycle, access to diverse population, use of multimedia. Crowdsourcing is more effective than alternative online tools due to easier recruitment process and respondents’ reputation system.",42548

A common goal for these companies is to create aesthetically appealing compositions that highlight objects of interest within the context of a scene. Unfortunately, this goal is challenging, not only due to the need to balance the trade-off among aesthetic principles and design constraints, but also because of the huge search space induced by possible camera parameters, object placement, material choices, etc. Previous methods have investigated only optimization of camera parameters. In this paper, we develop a tool that starts from an initial scene description and a set of high-level constraints provided by a stylist and then automatically generates an optimized scene whose 2D composition is improved. It does so by locally adjusting the 3D object transformations, surface materials, and camera parameters. The value of this tool is demonstrated in a variety of applications motivated by product catalogs, including rough layout refinement, detail image creation, home planning, cultural customization, and text inlay placement. Results of a perceptual study indicate that our system produces images preferable for product advertisement compared to a more traditional camera-only optimization.",

Design/methodology/approach – This study uses a 2 (medium: Twitter vs news release)×2 (country-of-origin: China vs France) factorial experiment. The participants (n=393) are recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk system (Mturks). Findings – The findings suggest that using Twitter substantially mitigates participants’ negative evaluation of the organization undergoing a crisis. Country-of-origin affects how individuals perceive the organization after it has experienced a crisis. In addition, participants’ product involvement intensifies the reputational threat specifically for the organization with a less favorable country-of-origin perception. Originality/value – This study is one of the few empirically based studies in international public relations research, using an experiment to extrapolate the effects of social media and country-of-origin on consumers’ crisis appraisal. This investigation reinforces the need to consider social media not just at the individual level, but also as a form of communication that can have broader consequences at the organizational level. In addition, it is important for company leaders to understand that the organization’s home country image may exacerbate the negative management outcomes during a crisis. It is expected that this study yields theoretically indicative, empirically informative, and culturally relevant results.",

This study seeks to bridge these two areas, considering the role that social media may play in correcting misinformation. To do so, we test a new function of Facebook, which provides related links when people click on a link within Facebook. We show users a post containing misinformation, and then manipulate the related stories to either confirm, correct, or both confirm and correct the misinformation. Findings suggest that when related stories correct a post that includes misinformation, misperceptions are significantly reduced.",

Kemp",British Journal of Psychology,,June 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12141/full,"Photo-identification is based on the premise that photographs are representative of facial appearance. However, previous studies show that ratings of likeness vary across different photographs of the same face, suggesting that some images capture identity better than others. Two experiments were designed to examine the relationship between likeness judgments and face matching accuracy. In Experiment 1, we compared unfamiliar face matching accuracy for self-selected and other-selected high-likeness images. Surprisingly, images selected by previously unfamiliar viewers – after very limited exposure to a target face – were more accurately matched than self-selected images chosen by the target identity themselves. Results also revealed extremely low inter-rater agreement in ratings of likeness across participants, suggesting that perceptions of image resemblance are inherently unstable. In Experiment 2, we test whether the cost of self-selection can be explained by this general disagreement in likeness judgments between individual raters. We find that averaging across rankings by multiple raters produces image selections that provide superior identification accuracy. However, benefit of other-selection persisted for single raters, suggesting that inaccurate representations of self interfere with our ability to judge which images faithfully represent our current appearance.",

In Experiment 1, we presented study lists that were blocked or alternated by meaning (within subjects), followed by a free recall test completed immediately or after a 2.5-min delay. Correct recall was greater for blocked than for alternated lists. Critical-lure false recall was greater for blocked lists on an immediate test, whereas both list types produced equivalent false recall on a delayed test. In Experiment 2, lists blocked and alternated by meaning were presented via a between-subjects design, in order to eliminate possible list-type carryover effects. Correct recall replicated the result from Experiment 1; however, blocking lists increased false recall on delayed, but not on immediate, tests. Across the experiments, clustering correct recall by meaning increased across the delay selectively for the alternated lists. Our results suggest that thematic (i.e., gist) processes are influential for false recall, especially following a delay, a pattern consistent with fuzzy-trace theory.",

Dyadic morality suggests that the answer is “no.” Despite moral diversity, we reveal that moral cognition—in both liberals and conservatives—is rooted in a harm-based template. A dyadic template suggests that harm should be central within moral cognition, an idea tested—and confirmed—through six specific hypotheses. Studies suggest that moral judgment occurs via dyadic comparison, in which counter-normative acts are compared with a prototype of harm. Dyadic comparison explains why harm is the most accessible and important of moral content, why harm organizes—and overlaps with—diverse moral content, and why harm best translates across moral content. Dyadic morality suggests that various moral content (e.g., loyalty, purity) are varieties of perceived harm and that past research has substantially exaggerated moral differences between liberals and conservatives.",42546

In this article, we test the novel idea that some individuals respond to high-power roles by displaying not dominance but instead submissiveness. We theorize that high-power individuals who are also high in the need to belong experience the social distinctiveness associated with power as threatening, rather than as an arrangement to protect and maintain. We predict that such individuals will counter their feelings of threat with submissive behaviors to downplay their power and thereby reduce their distinctiveness. We found support for this hypothesis across three studies using different operationalizations of power, need to belong, and submissiveness. Furthermore, Study 3 illustrated the mediating role of fear of (positive) attention in the relationship between power, need to belong, and submissive behavior.",42543

Prior studies are limited because it remains unclear whether specific AS or IU dimensions differentially relate to certain cyberchondria dimensions. Methods: The present study examined associations among AS, IU, and cyberchondria dimensions using a sample of community adults (N=578) located in the United States. Results: As predicted, physical AS and inhibitory IU were the only AS or IU dimensions to share unique associations with the distress cyberchondria dimension after controlling for the overlap among the AS dimensions, IU dimensions, and health anxiety. Cognitive AS and social AS unexpectedly evidenced unique associations with cyberchondria dimensions. Limitations: The results are limited by the cross-sectional study design and use of a community, rather than clinical, sample. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that specific AS and IU dimensions may confer vulnerability to certain cyberchondria dimensions. Further clarifying associations among AS, IU, and cyberchondria may lead to improvements in our conceptualization and, ultimately, treatment of cyberchondria.",

Cues such as facial emotional resemblance are based on facial musculature and thus dynamic. Cues such as a face’s structure are based on the underlying bone and are thus relatively static. The current research examines the distinction between these types of facial cues by investigating the consistency in social evaluations arising from dynamic versus static cues. Specifically, across four studies using real faces, digitally generated faces, and downstream behavioral decisions, we demonstrate that social evaluations based on dynamic cues, such as intentions, have greater variability across multiple presentations of the same identity than do social evaluations based on static cues, such as ability. Thus, although evaluations of intentions vary considerably across different instances of a target’s face, evaluations of ability are relatively fixed. The findings highlight the role of facial cues’ consistency in the stability of social evaluations.",

Then, a second, primarily bi-national sample (n = 144) is used to expand the theory and examine the effects of identity, operationalized as independent and interdependent self-construal, on green behavioral intentions. The results indicate that how we define our self has a substantial impact on our intents to protect the environment. Our findings add to previous work on the role of self-identity and provide a new theoretical perspective to guide green policy and changes aimed at increasing sustainability.",

These are not differences of ability but rather preferences for processing certain types of information or for processing information in certain types of way. If accurate, learning styles theories could have important implications for instruction because student achievement would be a product of the interaction of instruction and the student’s style. There is reason to think that people view learning styles theories as broadly accurate, but, in fact, scientific support for these theories is lacking. We suggest that educators’ time and energy are better spent on other theories that might aid instruction.",

When judging the messages, warmth was emphasized by Democrats and competence by Republicans. Study 1b replicated these effects for messages about Romney as well. Study 2 examined the 2004 presidential election where perceptions of the party candidates’ warmth and competence reversed (Bush/warm; Kerry/competent). There competence was emphasized by Democrats and warmth by Republicans. Study 3 showed that varying the warmth and competence of each party’s prospective candidates for the 2016 election influences whether warmth or competence is emphasized by Democrats or Republicans. Thus, differences between Republicans and Democrats in emphasizing warmth or competence reflect a dynamic motivated cognition that is tailored to benefit their preferred candidate.",42538

In turn, this creates a need for tractable, and reliable, tools for measuring fundamental aspects of social relationships. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' (IOS) Scale, a handy pictorial tool for measuring the subjectively perceived closeness of a relationship. The tool is highly portable, very easy for subjects to understand and takes less than 1 minute to administer. Across our three online studies with a diverse adult population (n = 772) we show that six different scales designed to measure relationship closeness are all highly significantly positively correlated with the IOS Scale. We then conduct a Principal Component Analysis to construct an Index of Relationship Closeness and find that it correlates very strongly (ρ = 85) with the IOS Scale. We conclude that the IOS Scale is a psychologically meaningful and highly reliable measure of the subjective closeness of relationships.",

The limited research examining group-affirmation and bias, however, is inconclusive. We argue that group-affirmation can exacerbate group-serving biases in certain contexts, and in the current set of studies, we document this phenomenon directly. Unlike self-affirmation, group-affirmation led to greater ingroup-favoring evaluative judgments among political partisans (Experiment 1). This increase in evaluative bias following group-affirmation was moderated by political party identification and was not found among those who affirmed a non-political ingroup (Experiment 2). In addition, the mechanism underlying these findings is explored and interpreted within the theoretical frameworks of self-categorization theory and the multiple self-aspects model (Experiments 2 and 3). The broader implications of our findings for the understanding of social identity and affirmation theory are discussed.",

Large labeled training datasets, expensive and tedious to produce, are required to optimize millions of parameters in deep network models. Lagging behind the growth in model capacity, the available datasets are quickly becoming outdated in terms of size and density. To circumvent this bottleneck, we propose to amplify human effort through a partially automated labeling scheme, leveraging deep learning with humans in the loop. Starting from a large set of candidate images for each category, we iteratively sample a subset, ask people to label them, classify the others with a trained model, split the set into positives, negatives, and unlabeled based on the classification confidence, and then iterate with the unlabeled set. To assess the effectiveness of this cascading procedure and enable further progress in visual recognition research, we construct a new image dataset, LSUN. It contains around one million labeled images for each of 10 scene categories and 20 object categories. We experiment with training popular convolutional networks and find that they achieve substantial performance gains when trained on this dataset.",42536

Lebowitz, Woo-kyoung Ahn",Behaviour Research and Therapy,,August 2015,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796715001047,"Biological attributions for depression, which are currently ascendant, can lead to prognostic pessimism—the perception that symptoms are relatively immutable and unlikely to abate (Kvaale, Haslam, & Gottdiener, 2013; Lebowitz, Ahn, & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2013). Among symptomatic individuals, this may have important clinical ramifications, as reduced confidence in one's own ability to overcome depression carries the risk of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Previous research (Lebowitz, Ahn, et al., 2013) has demonstrated that educational interventions teaching symptomatic individuals about how the effects of genetic and neurobiological factors involved in depression are malleable and can be modified by experiences and environmental factors can reduce prognostic pessimism. While previous research demonstrated such effects only in the immediate term, the present research extends these findings by testing whether such benefits persist six weeks after the intervention. Indeed, among individuals who initially considered biological factors to play a major role in influencing their levels of depression, exposure to malleability-focused psychoeducation reduced levels of depression-related prognostic pessimism and stronger belief in their ability to regulate their moods. Critically, this benefit persisted six weeks after the intervention. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed.",

We investigated the impact of indoor tanning device warnings that communicate the risks associated with indoor tanning (i.e., loss framed) or the benefits of avoiding indoor tanning (i.e., gain framed). Methods. A convenience sample of non-Hispanic White women aged 18 to 30 years who tanned indoors at least once in the past year (n = 682) participated in a within-subjects experiment. Participants completed baseline measures and reported indoor tanning intentions and intentions to quit indoor tanning in response to 5 warning messages in random order. A text-only control warning was based on Food and Drug Administration–required warnings for indoor tanning devices. Experimental warnings included graphic content and were either gain or loss framed. Results. In multivariable analyses, gain-framed warnings did not differ from the control warning on women’s intentions to tan indoors, but they prompted stronger intentions to quit than the control message. Loss-framed warnings significantly reduced intentions to tan indoors and increased intentions to quit indoor tanning compared with control and gain-framed warnings. Conclusions. The public health impact of indoor tanning device warnings can be enhanced by incorporating graphic content and leveraging gain- and loss-framed messaging.",

Although health information seeking models have used worry as a determinant of information seeking, the present study sought to demonstrate the reverse causality to show the psychological impact of the Internet in the health context. Study 1 (N = 308), a cross-sectional survey, recruited U.S. participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowd-sourcing online marketplace, and detected a positive association between online cancer information seeking from professional health-related websites and cancer worry. To establish the causality, Study 2 (N = 1130 at Wave 1 and 813 at Wave 2), a two-wave survey about stomach cancer in South Korea, was conducted. The results showed that online cancer information seeking from online news at Wave 1 increased cancer worry at Wave 2. Although the sources of cancer information seeking associated with cancer worry were different in Study 1 (professional health-related websites) and Study 2 (online news), the results were consistent in that each was the main source of cancer information for Study 1 and Study 2 participants, respectively. The findings suggested that online cancer information seeking from these frequently used sources can increase cancer worry, which plays a positive role in cancer prevention.",

Specifically, individual differences in prevention and promotion focus are related to reputational concerns. Building on the assumption that prevention-focused individuals are sensitive to and concerned with oughts and social expectations, it is expected that prevention-focused individuals are particularly concerned regarding their reputation. In line with this assumption, Study 1 documents a positive relation between individual differences in prevention focus and reputational concerns (beyond the Big Five and perceived stress). In Study 2, individuals are exposed to a subtle reputation cue (i.e., stylized watching eyes). It is documented that prevention-focused individuals specifically react to this cue in that they donate more money when such a cue is present. This finding is replicated in an additional sample and shown to be independent of the Big Five. In sum, the present work contributes to a better understanding of basic motivational orientations regarding reputational concerns.",
MTurk Method,,,,808,Feelings of Pride and Respect as Drivers of Ongoing Member Activity on Crowdsourcing Platforms,"Mark Boons, Daan Stam, Harry G. Barkema",Journal of Management Studies,,August 2015,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joms.12140/abstract,"Crowdsourcing platforms are online organizations that organize work by sourcing tasks to their members. As participation on crowdsourcing platforms is completely voluntary, getting members to actively participate in tasks on an ongoing basis is essential for the survival of these online platforms. Why members would be active on an ongoing basis, however, is currently not well understood. To understand ongoing member activity on crowdsourcing platforms, we build on the group engagement model, which postulates that feelings of pride and respect influence engagement because they foster identification with the group. We argue that, although in general the nature of crowdsourcing platforms limits the effects of identification processes on member behaviour, feelings of pride and respect will still play central roles in such online organizations, because feelings of pride and respect can directly drive members’ cooperative behaviors towards the platform organization. Moreover, we posit that the way in which platform organizations communicate with their members affects these feelings of pride and respect. We test these ideas in a longitudinal, multisource field study and find that feelings of pride drive ongoing member activity on an online crowdsourcing platform directly and that platform management can increase members’ feelings of pride and respect by engaging in specific organizational communication practices.",42535

The prompt accurate assessment of surgical skill remains a challenge, in part, because expert faculty reviewers are often unavailable. By harnessing the power of large readily available crowds through the Internet, rapid, accurate, and low-cost assessments may be achieved. We hypothesized that assessments provided by crowd workers highly correlate with expert surgeons' assessments. Materials and Methods: A group of 49 surgeons from two hospitals performed two dry-laboratory robotic surgical skill assessment tasks. The performance of these tasks was video recorded and posted online for evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The surgical tasks in each video were graded by (n=30) varying crowd workers and (n=3) experts using a modified global evaluative assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) grading tool, and the mean scores were compared using Cronbach's alpha statistic. Results: GEARS evaluations from the crowd were obtained for each video and task and compared with the GEARS ratings from the expert surgeons. The crowd-based performance scores agreed with the performance assessments by experts with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and 0.92 for the two tasks, respectively. Conclusion: The assessment of surgical skill by crowd workers resulted in a high degree of agreement with the scores provided by expert surgeons in the evaluation of basic robotic surgical dry-laboratory tasks. Crowd responses cost less and were much faster to acquire. This study provides evidence that crowds may provide an adjunctive method for rapidly providing feedback of skills to training and practicing surgeons.",

Experiment 1 established that both Americans and Indians perceived that most others would disapprove of individuals who made choices primarily based on their own preferences compared to individuals who also took other factors into consideration. Experiments 2 and 3 found that when either general normative concerns or specific norms were highlighted, Indians’ preference–choice consistency shifted whereas Americans’ did not. Experiment 4 demonstrated that motivating people to act counter-normatively (rather than normatively) increased Indians’ preference–choice consistency but had no influence on Americans’. The findings indicate that even when the norm content does not differ across cultures, people from a more interdependent culture are more susceptible to normative influence than people from a more independent culture.",

Despite the subjectivity and inherent dif- ficulty of the annotation task, correlations between mean ratings were quite encouraging, especially on formality and informativeness. We further explored correlation between the three linguistic variables, genre-wise variation of ratings and correlations within genres, compatibility with automatic stylistic scoring, and sentential make-up of a document in terms of style. To date, our corpus is the largest sentence-level annotated corpus released for formality, informativeness, and implicature.",

We introduce connotation frames as a representation formalism to organize these rich dimensions of connotation using typed relations. First, we investigate the feasibility of obtaining connotative labels through crowdsourcing experiments. We then present models for predicting the connotation frames of verb predicates based on their distributional word representations and the interplay between different types of connotative relations. Empirical results confirm that connotation frames can be induced from various data sources that reflect how people use language and give rise to the connotative meanings. We conclude with analytical results that show the potential use of connotation frames for analyzing subtle biases in online news media.",

We apply this framework to the study of healthcare experiences in two studies. Methods: In Study 1, mTurk users (N = 670) read vignettes of positive, neutral, or negative healthcare experiences, described their construal of the vignette, and completed individual difference measures. In Study 2, mTurk users (N = 292) recalled a recent healthcare visit and reported individual differences, visit characteristics, and outcomes following the visit. Results: Across both studies, personality was related to the valenced construal of healthcare experiences. In Study 2, patient and visit characteristics predicted situational construal and self-reported visit outcomes, and situational construal statistically mediated relationships between patient and visit characteristics and outcomes. Conclusions: The current work supports the application of the Situational Construal Model to healthcare situations and demonstrates the importance of both person and situation variables for understanding key healthcare outcomes.",

Gibson",Behavior Research Methods,January,January 2017,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617300114,"The use of online crowdsourcing services like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) as a method of collecting behavioral data online has become increasingly popular in recent years. A growing body of contemporary research has empirically validated the use of AMT as a tool in psychological research by replicating a wide range of well-established effects that have been previously reported in controlled laboratory studies. However, the potential for AMT to be used to conduct spatial cuing experiments has yet to be investigated in depth. Spatial cuing tasks are typically very basic in terms of their stimulus complexity and experimental testing procedures, thus making them ideal for remote testing online that requires minimal task instruction. Studies employing the spatial cuing paradigm are typically aimed at unveiling novel facets of the symbolic control of attention, which occurs whenever observers orient their attention through space in accordance with the meaning of a spatial cue. Ultimately, the present study empirically validated the use of AMT to study the symbolic control of attention by successfully replicating four hallmark effects reported throughout the visual attention literature: the left/right advantage, cue type effect, cued axis effect, and cued endpoint effect. Various recommendations for future endeavors using AMT as a means of remotely collecting behavioral data online are also provided. In sum, the present study provides a crucial first step toward establishing a novel tool for conducting psychological research that can be used to expedite not only our own scientific contributions, but also those of our colleagues.",

Cowan,Social Science & Medicine,January,January 2017,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617300114,"Rationale: Abortion is a common medical procedure at the center of political debate. Yet, abortion stigma at the individual level is under-researched; the nascent research on abortion stigma has not yet documented enacted (experienced) stigma instead capturing anticipated or internalized stigma. Objective: This study documents how women and men who disclosed abortions perceived others’ reactions and determinants of those perceptions. Method: The study uses the American Miscarriage and Abortion Communication Survey, a survey representative of American-resident adults. Data from the sub-sample who had personal experience with abortion were analyzed (total sample, N = 1640; abortion disclosure sub-sample, n = 179). The survey captured each disclosure of the most recent abortion. Respondents had eight possible choices for articulating how the listener reacted. Cluster analyses grouped these reactions. Multinomial logistic regression identified predictors of the perceived reactions. Ordinal logistic regression revealed which disclosers perceived exclusively negative reactions, exclusively positive reactions, and a mix of negative and positive reactions. Results: Each disclosure fell into one of three clusters: negative reaction, supportive reaction or sympathetic reaction. The majority of abortion disclosures received largely positive reactions (32.6% were characterized as supportive and 40.6% were characterized as sympathetic). A substantial minority of disclosures received a negative reaction (26.8%). The perceived valence of the reaction is predicted, in part, by to whom the disclosure was made and why. Across all their disclosures, most people disclosing an abortion history perceived only positive reactions (58.3%). A substantial minority of people perceived either exclusively negative reactions (7.6%) or a mix of negative and positive reactions (34.1%). Ordinal logistic regression (with people as the unit of analysis) showed perceived reactions are predicted by the number of disclosures made and the revealer's race and income. Conclusion: Whereas most people disclosing an abortion received support or sympathy, a substantial minority received stigmatizing reactions, which could plausibly have a negative impact on health.",

To gain a better understanding of this link, we investigated the association between attachment styles and self-regulatory mode orientations. According to regulatory mode theory, locomotors are concerned with initiating goal-directed movement, whereas assessors are concerned with appraising potential means and goals. We predicted that the presence of an attachment figure with whom one has an anxious attachment would be associated with higher assessment tendencies. In addition, we predicted that the presence of an attachment figure with whom one has an avoidant attachment would be associated with lower locomotion tendencies. Five studies (N = 1,434) supported our predictions, and demonstrated that attachment styles and self-regulatory mode orientations covary across interaction partners.",

Bacharach",American Journal of Criminal Justice,January,January 2017,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12103-017-9387-5,"In the present studies, participants viewed a brief staged video of a physical confrontation between a police officer and a civilian. Participants were then asked if the police officer had used excessive force. When people view videos of police officer-civilian confrontations, their judgements concerning the use of excessive force by officers are likely constrained by various framing factors. Our studies were designed to investigate the effects of two different contextual frames on participants’ judgements of police officer use of excessive force. 1) We investigated how informational frames accompanying a confrontation video, might frame judgments about use of excessive force, and 2) we investigated how demographic frames, or demographic characteristics, might frame judgments of excessive force. In Study 1, an informational frame warned participants that the confrontation video captured a very brief segment of an event that transpired over a longer period of time. In Study 2, the video was accompanied with an informational frame in which a rationale for the activity of the police officer was explained. Police officer gender was experimentally manipulated in both studies: participants saw a video of either a female or a male police officer affecting an arrest. Participant demographic information was also collected. Logistic regression analysis showed that judgments of excessive force were related to participant demographic characteristics but not to police officer gender. The informational frames appeared to have no effect on excessive force judgments. The results have implications for future research regarding the types of factors that frame people’s judgments of the use of force by police officers when watching police officer-civilian confrontation videos. The results also have implications for efforts to provide a context for these types of videos when they appear in television news programs.",

This so-called “gambler’s fallacy” has been replicated robustly. However, what drives gambler’s fallacy behavior is unclear. Here we demonstrate that a run of the same external outcome by itself does not lead to gambler’s fallacy behavior. However, when a run of external outcomes is accompanied by a concurrent run of failed guesses, gambler’s fallacy behavior is predominant. These results do not depend on how participants’ attention is directed. Thus, it appears that gambler’s fallacy behavior is driven by a combination of an external series of events and a concurrent series of failure experiences.",

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey questionnaire among fully-employed workers in the United States. Data were analyzed using a structural equation model (n = 547). Findings: The results of this study showed a positive direct relationship between differentiation of self and affective and normative types of commitment. Differentiation of self also showed a direct negative relationship with continuance commitment. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest that managers may be able to look to differentiation of self to facilitate commitment to the organization. Managers who screen applicants at the recruitment stage or train current employees in self-differentiation may be able to increase overall commitment levels among employees of the organization. Originality/value: This research empirically extends family systems theory to workplace settings. It also expands the understanding of organizational commitment through the perspectives of psychological and relational functioning.,

In order to help scholars converge on a unified understanding of BA, we conducted a thorough literature review which identified forty purported dimensions of BA. Our critical analysis resulted in a two-dimensional (i.e., originality and genuineness) conceptualization of the construct. Brand authenticity is defined as the extent to which a brand is considered unique, legitimate, truthful to its claims, and lacking falsity. This study conceptualizes BA as a second-order reflective–formative construct. A new scale for BA was proposed and then tested on data collected about Goodwill using Mechanical Turk. SmartPLS (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data using the two-stage approach. This study found that BA formatively comprises two theorized dimensions, and the proposed BA scale is valid and reliable. The major contribution of this study will be in improving the conceptualization of BA by unifying the fragmented literature and also presenting a scale developed and tested for the further study of BA.",

Data sanitization is one of countermeasures against poisoning attack. It is a data pre-processing method which filters suspect samples before learning. Recently, a number of data sanitization methods are devised for label flip attack, but their flexibility is limited due to specific assumptions. It is observed that abrupt label flip caused by attack changes complexity of classification. A data sanitization method based on data complexity, which is a measure of the difficulty of classification on a dataset, is proposed in this paper. Our method measures the data complexity of a training set after removing a sample and its nearest samples. Contaminated samples are then distinguished from untainted samples according to their data complexity values. Experimental results support the idea that data complexity can be used to identify attack samples. The proposed method achieves a better result than the current sanitization method in terms of detection accuracy for well known security application problems.",

In two experiments, retrieving many instances of recent socialization reduced self-esteem and satisfaction of Basic Needs, which are responses associated with external cues of social rejection. These results show that experienced difficulty recalling many recent experiences of social acceptance provide meta-cognitive input that social needs are not being satisfied, even if the individual recalls more instances of acceptance than someone who easily recalls fewer.",

We use attribution theory and the attribution-expectancy framework to explain the theoretical relationships we advance and test our hypotheses in two independent experiments that stimulate co-creation through role-play and vignettes. The results show that customer co-creation shifts the attribution for failure to the self, resulting in atypical shifts in expectancy (increasing customers’ expectancy of future success and motivation to continue co-creating in the future). Our results suggest that utilizing customers’ efforts and skills in the co-creation of products and services can help firms to manage failure effectively. The implications of our findings on co-creation research and product and service failures are discussed, specific applications within the digital context are considered, and suggestions are offered for future research.",

Legislation prohibiting weight discrimination has been proposed as an avenue for reducing social injustice. The present research examines how mere knowledge of such legislation may improve the psychological well-being of individuals who have experienced unfair treatment due to weight. In an experiment administered online, 214 adults with overweight/obesity read a vignette exemplifying weight discrimination and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, in which they were informed that weight discrimination was illegal or legal, and then responded to questionnaires assessing internalized weight bias, affect, perceived pervasiveness of weight discrimination, and support for anti-discrimination legislation. Analysis of covariance revealed that participants with obesity in the Illegal condition exhibited lower levels of internalized weight bias than did participants in the Legal condition. Participants in the Illegal condition also exhibited less negative affect and more positive affect than did those in the Legal condition. No significant effects of condition on perceived pervasiveness of weight discrimination or legislation support emerged. Findings suggest that mere knowledge of legislation prohibiting weight discrimination has the potential to reduce weight bias internalization and improve affective responses among individuals with obesity.",

Recently, some researchers have questioned the replicability of such priming effects. This article adds to this conversation by investigating a moderator of power recall effects: ease of retrieval. Four experiments find that the effects of the power recall manipulation are reduced or even reversed when the power episode is difficult to recall. This moderation is demonstrated across three effects associated with power: confidence, disobedience, and unethical behavior. This moderation occurs regardless of whether ease of retrieval was measured or manipulated. These findings offer insight to the efficacy of the power recall manipulation and provide one explanation for failures to replicate (i.e., populations or situations differ in ease of retrieval). Overall, this work encourages a cumulative science by fine-tuning our understanding of when recalling experiences of power drive behavior.",

Yet, in light of the increasing politicization of (climate) science, and the attempts of vested-interest groups to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change through organized “disinformation campaigns,” identifying ways to effectively engage with the public about the issue across the political spectrum has proven difficult. A growing body of research suggests that one promising way to counteract the politicization of science is to convey the high level of normative agreement (“consensus”) among experts about the reality of human-caused climate change. Yet, much prior research examining public opinion dynamics in the context of climate change has done so under conditions with limited external validity. Moreover, no research to date has examined how to protect the public from the spread of influential misinformation about climate change. The current research bridges this divide by exploring how people evaluate and process consensus cues in a polarized information environment. Furthermore, evidence is provided that it is possible to pre-emptively protect (“inoculate”) public attitudes about climate change against real-world misinformation.",

Legislation prohibiting weight discrimination has been proposed as an avenue for reducing social injustice. The present research examines how mere knowledge of such legislation may improve the psychological well-being of individuals who have experienced unfair treatment due to weight. In an experiment administered online, 214 adults with overweight/obesity read a vignette exemplifying weight discrimination and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, in which they were informed that weight discrimination was illegal or legal, and then responded to questionnaires assessing internalized weight bias, affect, perceived pervasiveness of weight discrimination, and support for anti-discrimination legislation. Analysis of covariance revealed that participants with obesity in the Illegal condition exhibited lower levels of internalized weight bias than did participants in the Legal condition. Participants in the Illegal condition also exhibited less negative affect and more positive affect than did those in the Legal condition. No significant effects of condition on perceived pervasiveness of weight discrimination or legislation support emerged. Findings suggest that mere knowledge of legislation prohibiting weight discrimination has the potential to reduce weight bias internalization and improve affective responses among individuals with obesity.",

Specifically, this study tests if including a temporal contiguity cue in a review can significantly enhance the purchase intention of other consumers toward the reviewed business. Design/methodology/approach: A 2 (personal sense of power) x 2 (temporal contiguity cue: manipulated to be absent vs. present) quasi-experiment was conducted in this research. Floodlight analysis with Johnson-Neyman technique was used to test the interaction effect. Hayes’ PROCESS procedure was used to test the mediation effects. Findings: The study found that, for powerless consumers, temporal contiguity cue can effectively enhance the perceived trustworthiness of the review and purchase intention toward the reviewed business. Conversely, for powerful consumers, temporal contiguity cue can significantly reduce the perceived trustworthiness of the review and purchase intention toward the business. Mediation test further revealed evidence for the underlying psychological mechanism for these effects. Originality/value: Revealing the mixed effects of a novel factor, temporal contiguity cue, on consumer responses toward online hospitality reviews, the current research contributes to the expanding stream of theoretical and managerial knowledge on online review management in social media platforms.",

As one of the most prominent characteristics of research in AI 2.0 era, crowd intelligence has attracted much attention from both industry and research communities. Specifically, crowd intelligence provides a novel problem-solving paradigm through gathering the intelligence of crowds to address challenges. In particular, due to the rapid development of the sharing economy, crowd intelligence not only becomes a new approach to solving scientific challenges, but has also been integrated into all kinds of application scenarios in daily life, e.g., online-tooffline (O2O) application, real-time traffic monitoring, and logistics management. In this paper, we survey existing studies of crowd intelligence. First, we describe the concept of crowd intelligence, and explain its relationship to the existing related concepts, e.g., crowdsourcing and human computation. Then, we introduce four categories of representative crowd intelligence platforms. We summarize three core research problems and the state-of-the-art techniques of crowd intelligence. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions of crowd intelligence.",
,,,,837,Generation Y's positive and negative eWOM: use of social media and mobile technology,"Tingting(Christina) Zhang , Behzad Abound Omran , Cihan Cobanoglu",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,January,January 2017,http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/IJCHM-10-2015-0611,"Purpose: This study explored the factors that influence Generation Y’s positive or negative electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) behavior via social media and mobile technology in the foodservice sector. Three types of dining experiences were examined: positive and negative customer experiences and negative customer service followed by a satisfactory recovery package. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was adopted to test the factors posited to influence Generation Y consumers in these service contexts. Participants were recruited through Amazon M-Turk, and multi-group structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the data. Findings: Active use of social media and peer influence had a sweeping influence on Generation Y’s intentions to engage in eWOM about their service experiences. Technological sophistication with mobile technology influenced Generation Y to spread positive or negative service experiences, rather than satisfactory recovery experiences. Family influence had a mixed influence on Generation Y subgroups (21-24 years old vs. 25-35 years old) to engage in eWOM about their satisfactory or poor service experiences. In satisfactory recovery experiences, family influence showed no significant influence on Generation Y’s eWOM behaviors. Research limitations/implications: This study enriches online reviews and eWOM marketing theories, adds to service failure and recovery literature, and enhances understanding of consumer behavior expressed by Generation Y through the empirical investigation of Generation Y consumers’ behavioral motivations to engage in eWOM through social media and mobile technology. Practical implications: Engaging Generation Y consumers with social media campaigns and mobile technology development is not merely sufficient in eWOM marketing strategies. Instead, it is essential to create integrative peer communities to motivate Generation Y consumers to engage in eWOM marketing. Marketers need to pay attention to the mixed effects of family influences on the eWOM behaviors of subgroups of Generation Y in positive or negative service experiences. Originality/value: Given the scarcity of consumer behavior research into Generation Y as an emerging market segment, this paper makes an incremental contribution by developing and validating a model of factors that influence Generation Y consumers’ eWOM intentions through social networking and mobile technologies in three major service contexts: positive, negative, and recovery following a service failure.",

We propose an approach to effectively disentangle the discriminative features in the manner of collaborative utilization of collective wisdom (via human-labeled crowd labels) and deep learning (via human-generated data) for the NED task. In particular, we devise a crowd model to elicit the underlying features (crowd features) from crowd labels that indicate a matching candidate for each mention, and then use the crowd features to fine-tune a dynamic convolutional neural network (DCNN). The learned DCNN is employed to obtain deep crowd features to enhance traditional hand-crafted features for the NED task. The proposed method substantially benefits from the utilization of crowd knowledge (via crowd labels) into a generic deep learning for the NED task. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach is superior to the traditional hand-crafted features when enough crowd labels are gathered.",

Rice,X,January,January 2017,http://thekeep.eiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3514&context=theses,"Previous research has suggested that there may be a connection between the cannibalism taboo and sexual attraction. Specifically, it appears that when forced to choose someone to cannibalize, people choose victims in a pattern that mimics who they would choose to be sexually intimate with. To confirm and explore this relationship, the current study measured sexual orientation and examined whether participants' preferences in who to cannibalize if forced reflected their desired sexual partner. Participants recruited from Amazon Turk responded to forced pair choices regarding either desired sexual partner or cannibalism victims. Targets included all combinations of three variables: Physical Appearance (Attractive vs. Unattractive), Age (24 years old vs 80 years old), and gender. Planned contrasts were examined to see if patterns of preference were the same for sexual attraction and cannibalism. Results failed to confirm the connection between sexual attraction and cannibalism. In fact, our results could not provide any evidence that similar mechanisms of disgust were involved in preferences between preferred cannibalism victims and desired sexual partne",

The goal of query performance prediction is to estimate a query’s retrieval effectiveness without user feedback. Past research has investigated the usefulness of query performance predictors for the task of reducing verbose textual queries. The basic idea is to automatically find a shortened version of the original query that yields a better retrieval. To date, such techniques have been applied to TREC topic descriptions (as surrogates for verbose queries) and to long textual queries issued to a web search engine. In this paper, we build upon an existing query reduction approach that was applied to TREC topic descriptions and evaluate its generalizability to the new task of reducing spoken query transcriptions. Our results show that we are able to outperform the original spoken query by a small, but significant margin. Furthermore, we show that the terms that are omitted from better-performing sub-queries include extraneous terms not central to the query topic, disfluencies, and speech recognition errors.",

One view of task complexity is through the lens of a priori determinability—a measure of how much the searcher knows about the task outcomes, information requirements, and processes involved. In this paper, we explore a novel manipulation of a priori determinability in the context of comparative search tasks, which require comparing items (or alternatives) along different dimensions. Our manipulation involved explicitly including the items to be compared and/or the dimension by which to compare items in the search task description. We report on two user studies that investigate the effects of our manipulation on searchers’ pre-task perceptions, search behaviors and post-task outcomes. Our results found that specifying the items had an effect on searchers’ pre-task perceptions, but not their search behaviors and outcomes, and that specifying the dimension had no effect on perceptions, but made the task more difficult by possibly introducing uncertainty into the search process.",

Schmidt",,January,January 2017,http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~vickup/Warriner-CJEP-2016.pdf,"Reliable measurement of affective responses is critical for research into human emotion. Affective evaluation of words is most commonly gauged on multiple dimensions—including valence (positivity) and arousal—using a rating scale. Despite its popularity, this scale is open to criticism: it generates ordinal data that is often misinterpreted as interval, it does not provide the fine resolution that is essential by recent theoretical accounts of emotion, and its extremes may not be properly calibrated. In five experiments, we introduce a new slider tool for affective evaluation of words on a continuous, well-calibrated and high-resolution scale. In Experiment 1, participants were shown a word and asked to move a manikin representing themselves closer to or farther away from the word. The manikin’s distance from the word strongly correlated with the word’s valence. In Experiment 2, individual differences in shyness and sociability elicited reliable differences in distance from the words. Experiment 3 validated the results of Experiments 1 and 2 using a demographically more diverse population of responders. Finally, Experiment 4 (along with Experiment 2) suggested that task demand is not a potential cause for scale recalibration. In Experiment 5, men and women placed a manikin closer or farther from words that showed sex differences in valence, highlighting the sensitivity of this measure to group differences. These findings shed a new light on interactions among affect, language, and individual differences, and demonstrate the utility of a new tool for measuring word affect.",

This study assessed the opinions of SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants on their perceptions of the program and strategies to improve its nutritional impact. Methods: This study surveyed 387 individuals via Amazon Mechanical Turk, of whom 118 were SNAP participants and 269 were food insufficient but not enrolled in SNAP (nonparticipants). Open-ended questions were coded and analyzed for thematic content. For closed-ended questions, response frequencies were compared using chi-square tests. Data were analyzed in 2016. Results: SNAP participants reported that the program successfully served its primary purpose: to allow individuals to buy enough food to make ends meet and reduce food insecurity. Importance was placed on buying food for their children/families and the ability to allocate money for other expenses. To improve the nutritional impact, SNAP participants suggested more nutrition education, increasing the benefit allotment, incentivizing healthful foods, and excluding unhealthful foods for purchase with SNAP. When participants and nonparticipants were asked to choose between SNAP and a nutritionally enhanced program combining healthy incentives with exclusions for sugary beverages (i.e., SNAP+), 68% of participants and 83% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+. Of those who initially chose SNAP, 68% of participants and 64% of nonparticipants chose SNAP+ if paired with a 50% increase in total benefits. Conclusions: SNAP participants and food-insufficient nonparticipants support policies that facilitate purchases of healthful foods and limit purchases of unhealthful foods, specifically sugary beverages.",

Here, we demonstrate that greater plant and animal species richness in isolation causes an improvement in mental well-being. To do so, the present research experimentally manipulated species richness and assessed widely-used indicators of mental well-being. Participants viewed short videos of either high or low tree (Study 1) or bird (Study 2) species richness and reported on positive (i.e., vitality, positive affect) and negative (i.e., anxiety) indicators of mental well-being. Building on Study 1, Study 2 included an urban environment as a reference treatment and explored the role of giving participants information on the presented environment. We find that, in line with expectations, watching videos containing greater species richness consistently leads to higher mental well-being. We discuss findings in light of the importance of connecting people to biodiverse environments.",

We discuss two small studies exploring the psychometric properties of the SCC and the SCC-R (revised Social Communication Checklist), including sensitivity to change, inter-rater reliability, and test-retest reliability, in two samples of children with ASD and one sample of typically-developing children. Results indicate this measure is reliable, sensitive to change after a brief social communication intervention, and strongly related to well-established measures of social communicative functioning.",

The current study evaluated how high-cigarette dependent smokers evaluate these messages compared to low-cigarette dependent smokers using a mixed, 3 x 2 factorial design. A pilot study involving focus groups, interviews, and evaluation questionnaires (N=10) was conducted to classify graphic threat appeals and develop stimulus materials for the primary study. For the primary study, three graphic threat appeal conditions were evaluated by Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users (N=200). Findings suggested that the graphicness of the images significantly influenced arousal, aversive response, and persuasion. However, high-cigarette dependent smokers evaluated messages as less aversive than low-cigarette dependent smokers to the graphicness in messages. Additionally, low-cigarette dependent smokers may be at greater risk for experiencing cognitive overload and reallocating cognitive resources to defensive responses. Implications of these findings and recommendations for future research and message design are discussed.",

Participants completed the Sexual Narcissism Scale (Widman & McNulty, 2010), and then either recalled (Study 1), imagined (Study 2), or actually made (Study 3) a sexual comparison. We found that people high in sexual narcissism (compared with those lower in sexual narcissism) were more bothered when comparing themselves with someone with a higher sexual frequency and felt better about a comparison with someone with a lower sexual frequency. In turn, narcissists’ greater sensitivity to upward social comparisons predicted lower sexual and relationship satisfaction. These results suggest that those high in sexual narcissism may use downward sexual comparisons to maintain their grandiose self-views and be particularly sensitive to upward sexual comparisons.",

No systematic review on the topic has so far appeared in management journals, however; moreover, the field suffers from ambiguity in the topic's definition, which in turn has led to its largely unstructured evolution. The authors therefore investigate the existing body of knowledge on crowdsourcing systematically through a penetrating review in which the strengths and weakness of this literature stream are presented clearly and then future avenues of research are set out. The review is based on 121 scientific articles published between January 2006 and January 2015. The review recognizes that crowdsourcing is ingrained in two mainstream disciplines within the broader subject matter of innovation and management: (1) open innovation; and (2) co-creation. The review, in addition, also touches on several issues covered in other theoretical streams: (3) information systems management; (4) organizational theory and design; (5) marketing; and (6) strategy. The authors adopt a process perspective, applying the ‘Input–Process–Output’ framework to interpret research on crowdsourcing within the broad lines of: (1) Input (Problem/Task); (2) Process (session management; problem management; knowledge management; technology); and (3) Outcome (solution/completed task; seekers’ benefits; solvers’ benefits). This framework provides a detailed description of how the topic has evolved over time, and suggestions concerning the future direction of research are proposed in the form of research questions that are valuable for both academics and managers.",

In this paper, we focus on how accurately help-seekers predict a key determinant of help value, namely, helper effort. In four studies, we find that (a) helpers put more effort into helping than help-seekers expect (Studies 1–4); (b) people do not underestimate the effort others will expend in general, but rather only the effort others will expend helping them (Study 2); and (c) this underestimation of help effort stems from help-seekers’ failure to appreciate the discomfort—in particular, the guilt—that helpers would experience if they did not do enough to help (Studies 3 & 4).",

We present two methods for the alignment of Swedish easy-to-read text segments to text segments from a reference corpus. The first method (M1) was originally developed for the task of text reuse detection, measuring sentence similarity by a modified version of a TF-IDF vector space model. A second method (M2), also accounting for part-of-speech tags, was developed, and the methods were compared. For evaluation, a crowdsourcing platform was built for human judgement data collection, and preliminary results showed that cosine similarity relates better to human ranks than the Dice coefficient. We also saw a tendency that including syntactic context to the TF-IDF vector space model is beneficial for this kind of paraphrase alignment task",

Using a sample of 208 currently-employed online participants and structural equation modeling analyses we found that individuals scoring high on the Dark Triad traits reported engaging in some types of counterproductive work behavior less frequently when they perceived higher levels of organizational support.

A large and growing body of scholarship has attempted to predict the socio– technical outcomes of this shift, especially addressing three questions: 1) What are the complexity limits of on–demand work?, 2) How far can work be decomposed into smaller microtasks?, and 3) What will work and the place of work look like for workers? In this paper, we look to the historical scholarship on piecework — a similar trend of work decomposition, distribution, and payment that was popular at the turn of the 20th century — to understand how these questions might play out with modern on–demand work. We identify the mechanisms that enabled and limited piecework historically, and identify whether on–demand work faces the same pitfalls or might differentiate itself. This approach introduces theoretical grounding that can help address some of the most persistent questions in crowd work, and suggests design interventions that learn from history rather than repeat it.",

In this study, we analyzed responses from 630 parahippocampal neurons in 24 neurosurgical patients during visual stimulus presentation. We found a spatially clustered subpopulation of scene-selective units with an associated event-related field potential. These units form a population code that is more distributed for scenes than for other stimulus categories, and less sparse than elsewhere in the medial temporal lobe. Our electrophysiological findings provide insight into how individual units give rise to the population response observed with functional imaging in the parahippocampal place area.",

For example, a person may conclude that a happy relationship has eroded not from 1 obvious fight but from smaller unhappy signs that at some point “add up.” Everyday fluctuations therefore create ambiguity about when they reflect substantive shifts versus mere noise. Ten studies reveal an asymmetry in this first point when people conclude “official” change: people demand less evidence to diagnose lasting decline than lasting improvement, despite similar evidential quality. This effect was pervasive and replicated across many domains and parameters. For example, a handful of poor grades, bad games, and gained pounds led participants to diagnose intellect, athleticism, and health as “officially” changed; yet corresponding positive signs were dismissed as fickle flukes (Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c). This further manifested in real-time reactions: participants interpreted the same graphs of change in the economy and public health as more meaningful if framed as depicting decline versus improvement (Study 2), and were more likely to gamble actual money on continued bad versus good luck (Study 3). Why? Effects held across self/other change, added/subtracted change, and intended/unintended change (Studies 4a, 4b, and 4c), suggesting a generalized negativity bias. Teasing this apart, we highlight a novel “entropy” component beyond standard accounts like risk aversion: good things seem more truly capable of losing their positive qualities than bad things seem capable of gaining them, rendering signs of decline to appear more immediately diagnostic (Studies 5 and 6). An asymmetric tipping point raises theoretical and practical implications for how people might inequitably react to smaller signs of change.

There is arguably a downside to this belief, in that addicts who believe they lack the free will to quit an addiction might therefore fail to quit an addiction. Methods: A correlational study tested the relationship between belief in free will and addiction. Follow-up studies tested steps of a potential mechanism: 1) people think drugs undermine free will 2) people believe addiction undermines free will more when doing so serves the self 3) disbelief in free will leads people to perceive various temptations as more addictive. Results: People with lower belief in free will were more likely to have a history of addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and also less likely to have successfully quit alcohol. People believe that drugs undermine free will, and they use this belief to self-servingly attribute less free will to their bad actions than to good ones. Low belief in free will also increases perceptions that things are addictive. Conclusions: Addiction is widely seen as loss of free will. The belief can be used in self-serving ways that may undermine people's efforts to quit.",

However, despite the continuous implementation, a common phenomenon exists, i.e. lack of trust among crowdsourcing participants. Such lack may result in a lower rate of contract signing. The purpose of this study is to identity cognitive and affective determinants of initiators' willingness to sign a contract towards trust, and to understand the process of trust model in determining the trust formation mechanism. Results indicate perceived accreditation, network externality, absorptive capacity, track record and social capital are important in forming initiators' trust towards crowdsourcing platforms and bidders, which in turn will promote their signing intention.

Challenges for the Knowledge Society,January,January 2017,https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/mmcks.2016.11.issue-4/mmcks-2016-0016/mmcks-2016-0016.pdf,"People use two types of scheduling styles to schedule their daily activities, namely clock-time or event-time. When people use clock time, they organize tasks based on a clock. When they use event-time, they organize tasks based on their order of completion. This research shows that adopting different scheduling styles influence consumers’ assortment size preferences. We demonstrate, through two studies, that consumers using event-time scheduling style prefer a larger assortment size whereas consumers using clock-time scheduling style prefer a smaller assortment size. We also show that this effect is mediated by desirability-feasibility consideration. Specifically, event-time scheduling style leads consumers to focus on the desirability considerations, which leads them to prefer larger assortment size while shopping. On the other hand, clock-time scheduling style leads consumers to focus on the feasibility considerations, which leads them to prefer smaller assortment size while shopping. We also discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our research.",

Federmeier","Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience",January,January 2017,http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-016-0492-6,"An important question in the reading literature regards the nature of the semantic information readers can extract from the parafovea (i.e., the next word in a sentence). Recent eye-tracking findings have found a semantic parafoveal preview benefit under many circumstances, and findings from event-related brain potentials (ERPs) also suggest that readers can at least detect semantic anomalies parafoveally (Barber, Van der Meij, & Kutas, Psychophysiology, 50(1), 48–59, 2013). We use ERPs to ask whether fine-grained aspects of semantic expectancy can affect the N400 elicited by a word appearing in the parafovea. In an RSVP-with-flankers paradigm, sentences were presented word by word, flanked 2° bilaterally by the previous and upcoming words. Stimuli consisted of high constraint sentences that were identical up to the target word, which could be expected, unexpected but plausible, or anomalous, as well as low constraint sentences that were always completed with the most expected ending. Findings revealed an N400 effect to the target word when it appeared in the parafovea, which was graded with respect to the target’s expectancy and congruency within the sentence context. Furthermore, when targets appeared at central fixation, this graded congruency effect was mitigated, suggesting that the semantic information gleaned from parafoveal vision functionally changes the semantic processing of those words when foveated.",

We investigated whether the online platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), could be used as a resource to more easily recruit and measure the behavior of infant populations. Using a looking time paradigm, with users’ webcams we recorded how long infants aged 5 to 8 months attended while viewing children’s television programs. We found that infants (N = 57) were more reliably engaged by some movies than by others and that the most engaging movies could maintain attention for approximately 70% of a 10- to 13-min period. We then identified the cinematic features within the movies. Faces, singing-and-rhyming, and camera zooms were found to increase infant attention. Together, we established that MTurk can be used as a rapid tool for effectively recruiting and testing infants.",

An avatar is a graphical representation of an individual user in a virtual world. Users form judgments of other virtual world users based on the appearance and behavior of their avatars in the absence of physical cues. In particular, users have previously displayed sensitivity toward anthropomorphism and verbal behavior of avatars they encounter within virtual environments. Thus far, investigations of language in online and virtual spaces have been limited to specific contexts. University student participants and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers were shown two avatars. Each pair consisted of two out of three possible appearances: a tiger, a male, or a female. Each avatar was aligned with a different text introduction: one containing words of positive emotional valence and the other of negative emotional valence. Participants from both samples preferred avatars associated with positive language, regardless of appearance, but participants did not ascribe human control of an avatar based on either emotional valance or appearance. Significant differences for reported preferences and likeability demonstrate the salience of emotive language as a social cue even in short text introductions for avatars. These findings suggest that those we like and want to be around in virtual environments might not necessarily align with whom we view as human.",

In particular, theories allow that future actions in a plan are partially activated, but differ with respect to the width of the range, which refers to the number of future actions that are partially activated. Similarly, theories differ on the width of the range for recently completed actions that are assumed to be rapidly deactivated or gradually deactivated in a passive fashion. We validate a new typing task for measuring momentary activation states of actions across a response set during action sequencing. Typists recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk copied a paragraph by responding to a ""go"" signal that usually cued the next letter but sometimes cued a near-past or future letter (n-3, -2, -1, 0, +2, +3). The activation states for producing letters across go-signal positions can be inferred from RTs and errors. In general, we found evidence of graded parallel activation for future actions and rapid deactivation of more distal past actions.",

Additionally, small participant pools create barriers to replication while differing laboratory environments make it difficult to share protocols with precision, limiting the reproducibility of developmental research. Here we introduce a new platform, “Lookit,” that addresses these constraints by allowing families to participate in behavioral studies online via webcam. We show that this platform can be used to test infants (11–18 months), toddlers (24–36 months), and preschoolers (36–60 months) and reliably code looking time, preferential looking, and verbal responses, respectively; empirical results of these studies are presented in Scott, Chu, and Schulz (2016). In contrast to most laboratory-based studies, participants were roughly representative of the American population with regards to income, race, and parental education. We discuss broad technical and methodological aspects of the platform, its strengths and limitations, recommendations for researchers interested in conducting developmental studies online, and issues that remain before online testing can fulfill its promise.",

Three studies investigated how these arguments affect U.S. citizens' attitudes toward U.S.-committed torture. In Study 1, participants expressed stronger demands for redressing the injustice of torture when presented with moral rather than pragmatic or no arguments against torture. Study 2 replicated this finding with an extended justice measure and also showed the moderating role of ingroup glorification and attachment. Moral arguments increased justice demands among those who typically react most defensively to ingroup-committed wrongdoings: the highly attached and glorifying. Study 3 showed that the effect of moral arguments against torture on justice demands and support for torture among high glorifiers is mediated by moral outrage and empathy but not guilt.",

Respondents were randomly assigned to one of six message conditions or to a control condition (no message) and then asked their views about eliminating the use of incarceration for select nonviolent offenses. Results from ordinal logistic regression models suggest that message frames that appeal to a respondent’s self-interest or emphasize the unfairness of the punishment (not who is punished) tend to be most effective.",

Methods An online survey was used to assess the prevalence and perceptions of e-cigarette use among pregnant women, including perceptions of e-cigarette safety. Results In our sample, 5.62% (n = 25) of women solely used tobacco cigarettes, 6.52% (n = 29) solely used e-cigarettes, 8.54% (n = 38) used both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and 79.33% (n = 353) used neither tobacco cigarettes nor e-cigarettes during their current pregnancy. Overall, 64.27% (n = 286) of participants viewed e-cigarettes as being safer than tobacco cigarettes. Having seen advertisements for e-cigarettes increased likelihood of viewing them as safer than tobacco cigarettes (OR [Odds Ratio] = 2.5, p < .01). Conclusions for Practice Taken together, findings from this study suggest that at least as many women use e-cigarettes during pregnancy as tobacco cigarettes, that pregnant women view e-cigarettes as being safer than tobacco cigarettes, and that these views may be influenced by exposure to e-cigarette advertisements.",

Items were developed on basis of prior literature, vetted through expert feedback and cognitive interviews, and administered to 655 Asian American participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Exploratory factor analysis with a random subsample (n = 324) yielded a psychometrically robust preliminary measurement model consisting of 3 factors: Self-Negativity, Weakness Stereotypes, and Appearance Bias. Confirmatory factor analysis with a separate subsample (n = 331) indicated that the proposed correlated factors model was strongly consistent with the observed data. Factor determinacies were high and demonstrated that the specified items adequately measured their intended factors. Bifactor modeling further indicated that this multidimensionality could be univocally represented for the purpose of measurement, including the use of a mean total score representing a single continuum of internalized racism on which individuals vary. The IRAAS statistically predicted depressive symptoms, and demonstrated statistically significant correlations in theoretically expected directions with four dimensions of collective self-esteem. These results provide initial validity evidence supporting the use of the IRAAS to measure aspects of internalized racism in this population. Limitations and research implications are discussed.",

If this is true, excessive reliance on jargon could interfere with the dissemination of effective services. To address this often discussed but rarely studied issue, we consulted a large, public-domain list of English words that have been rated by members of the general public for the emotional reactions they evoke. Selected words that behavior analysts use as technical terms were compared to selected words that are commonly used to discuss general science, general clinical work, and behavioral assessment. There was a tendency for behavior analysis terms to register as more unpleasant than other kinds of professional terms, and also as more unpleasant than English words generally. We suggest possible reasons for this finding; discuss its relevance to the challenge of deciding how to communicate with consumers who don’t yet understand or value behavior analysis; and advocate for systematic research to guide the marketing of behavior analysis.",
,,,,876,Psychological Detachment from Work and the Threat of Role Ambiguity,"Meltzer, Daniel P",X,January,January 2017,http://search.proquest.com/docview/1837397126,"The ability to gain psychological distance from ones work outside of work is seen to be a necessary first step in enabling the process of recovery from work stress. The Stressor-Detachment model of work stress (Sonnentag, 2011) has supported this, showing how employees exposed to higher levels of job stressors find it more difficult to gain a sense of psychological distance from their work outside of the work situations, and in turn suffer greater levels of strains. I proposed that role ambiguity poses a unique threat to psychological detachment, and that this would be moderated by tolerance for ambiguity; such that individuals who are more tolerant of ambiguity will be more likely to psychologically detach from work following experiencing role ambiguity. Role ambiguity in the workplace is unique from other stressors such as workload and time pressure in that it is primarily knowledge-based. Continued thought on the ambiguity issue could resolve it, as opposed to workload or time pressure where the only solution is to work with greater speed or for more hours. Therefore, the current research was undertaken to assess causally and longitudinally the effect of role ambiguity on psychological detachment from work, as well as the possible mediation by personal tolerance for ambiguity. This research took place in two studies, one a lab study using Masters-level students testing the effect of manipulated role ambiguity on predicted psychological detachment from work, the other a three-time longitudinal study using participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service. The lab study used vignettes to manipulate the role ambiguity of students in the sample, who were then asked to predict the level of psychological detachment from work they would experience following the day described in the vignettes. The vignettes were developed for an early career audience, and a statistically significant difference in role ambiguity was detected. However, a statistically significant difference in predictions of psychological detachment from work was not seen given the effect size of the manipulation and sample size. Several possible enhancements for future research are discussed. The longitudinal study used 162 participants across three points in time, each one month after the prior, to analyze the full mediation model proposed in the Stressor-Detachment model. Data were collected using Amazons mTurk service, and analyzed using several techniques including hierarchical regression and a bootstrap mediation analysis. Self-rated role ambiguity and O*Net-rated job-level role ambiguity were both seem to partially explain changes in outcomes over time. However, limited support was seen for the stressor-detachment model in this sample. Possible explanations for why this study differs from prior research are explored in the discussion. The findings of these studies support that role ambiguity plays a unique role in hindering individual’s tendency to psychological detach from work when compared to other stressors, though it failed to connect this hindrance directly to other outcomes. Future research can build on the findings and learnings from these studies, and further evidence for the detrimental effects of role ambiguity are provided for practitioners.",

Three studies were then conducted. In study 1, the item pool was developed and the adequacy of its content to assess each of the fourteen constructs was evaluated by consulting a panel of six subject expert academics. In study 2, the dimensionality was assessed in an adult North American sample (N = 560). The results supported the hierarchical factor structure. In study 3, further evidence confirmed the factor structure, and provided support for the measure's internal and test-retest reliability, measurement invariance across gender, age and a longitudinal period of 5 weeks, and criterion validity in an adult North American sample (N = 1101).

In Study 1, an email from a Chinese student requesting a meeting about graduate training was sent to 419 White professors with the name of the sender being varied (Xian versus Alex). Use of the Chinese name led to fewer responses and agreements to meet than using the Anglo name. In Study 2, a lecture recording from an international graduate student was presented to 185 White undergraduates with the name of the lecturer varied (Jian versus John). The preference for Anglo (Chinese) names over Chinese (Anglo) names was apparent among those high (low) in assimilationist and low (high) in multicultural ideologies. These findings point to an important interplay between partial intergroup membership and acculturation ideologies of perceivers in predicting bias.

However, there is evidence suggesting that when a large portion of consumers hate a brand, that negative emotion can be hazardous to a brand’s success. Abercrombie and Fitch’s 17 % quarterly drop in earnings after announcing the brand would not be available in sizes larger than size 10 demonstrates the potential hazards of brand hate (see van Delzen 2014). Given the difficulties and limited options available to marketers in dealing with the challenges of brand hate emotions, many managers take the traditional approach of turning the other cheek. In contrast, some companies are experimenting with using nontraditional approaches to deal with the problem of hate by addressing the situation head-on and publically acknowledging the existence of brand haters. Some companies even go as far as attempting to capitalize on the cache of being hated, a tactic particularly popular among polarizing brands. Luo et al.

Making this decision more complicated is the debate regarding the viability of aiming for the highest level of service or customer delight. One avenue of research missing from the literature is the impact of providing delight to one customer while in the presence of others. In response the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the emotional and cognitive reactions of the observing customer. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was utilized to evaluate a sample of 272 respondents. Additional moderation analysis was conducted on the impact of perceived deservingness. Findings: Findings indicate that the observing customer experiences the dual effects of joy and jealousy which both impact perceptions of unfairness and subsequent behaviors of complaining and repurchase. The perceived deservingness of the customer experiencing the delight is shown to reduce the impact of jealousy on unfairness. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations include cross-sectional data and the fact that the data were retrospective. Practical implications: This research suggests that firms should embrace the positive contagion that occurs between the delighted customer and observer while attempting to minimize the impact of jealousy. Originality/value: This is the first research to quantitatively evaluate the impact of a customer viewing another customer receiving delight.,

We define OCRs as positive or negative comments posted on the Internet by consumers regarding goods or services sold online. Despite growing adoption, OCRs are often criticized for their credibility since review information typically is not subject to verification (Johnson and Kaye 2002); and some firms strategically manipulate OCRs (Fahey and Weinberg 2003). To distinguish truthful reviews from deceptive ones, consumers commonly use peripheral cues to assess the credibility of online information (Petty and Cacioppo 1986).

The proposed model, which combines the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and technology acceptance model (TAM), was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) by using data collected from 412 restaurant customers. The study results indicated that the proposed model provides approximately 20% greater explanatory power and predictive accuracy than the original UTAUT model and demonstrates strong evidence of the effects of risk, security, and trust on customers' intentions to use NFC-based MP technology in restaurant settings. In addition, considering the total effect, attitude, security, and risk have the most substantial impact on customers’ behavioral intentions. The study results further demonstrate that risk, security, and trust are also important determinants, with direct and indirect impacts, of other critical constructs (i.e., effort expectancy, hedonic and utilitarian performance expectancy, attitude, and intention). The empirical findings provide valuable theoretical contributions for researchers and practical implications for restaurant operators and technology vendors by explaining the reasons as to why the NFC-based MP is not popular in North American restaurants.",

As such, the relations the larger construct bear with certain outcomes may mask heterogeneity apparent at the more basic trait level. This article used the Five Factor Narcissism Inventory, a Five-Factor Model–based measure of narcissism that allows for multiple levels of analysis, to examine the relative importance of narcissistic traits in relation to aggression, externalizing behavior, and self-esteem outcomes in two independent samples. The relative importance of the narcissism factors was determined through the use of dominance analysis—a relatively underused method for determining relative importance among a set of related predictors. The results showed that antagonism, compared with agentic extraversion and neuroticism, was the dominant predictor across all forms of aggressive behavior. Additional analyses showed that subscales within the broader factor of antagonism also showed differential importance relative to one another for certain aggression outcomes. The results are discussed in the context of the relation between narcissism and aggression and highlight the utility of using extensions of regression-based analyses to explore the heterogeneity within personality constructs.",

We focus on systematic integration of existing paraphrase resources to produce paraphrase candidates and later ask human annotators to judge paraphrasability in context. We first conduct a paraphrase-scoring annotation task with and without context for targets that are i) single- and multi-word expressions ii) verbs and nouns. We quantify how differently annotators score paraphrases when context information is provided. Furthermore, we report on experiments with automatic paraphrase ranking. If we regard the problem as a binary classification task, we obtain an F1–score of 81.56% and 79.87% for multi-word expressions and single words resp. using kNN classifier. Approaching the problem as a learning-to-rank task, we attain MAP scores up to 87.14% and 91.58% for multiword expressions and single words resp. using LambdaMART, thus yielding highquality contextualized paraphrased selection. Further, we provide the first dataset with paraphrase judgments for multi-word targets in context.",

For example, the predicted accuracy may reduce, but the complexity of inferred models and the number of necessary training samples may rise. Online outsourcing systems, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, allow labelers to label the same objects but still lack in their quality. Mostly noisy labels have multiple labels for same examples. Thus, an agnostic algorithm Positive LAbel frequency Threshold (PLAT) is projected to handle the issue of imbalanced noisy labeling. The main objective is to generate the training dataset and integrated labels of examples. This method is used to solve the issue of minority sample and also able to deal with imbalanced multiple noisy labeling. The PLAT is applied to the imbalanced dataset collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk and the experiment results represents that the PLAT is efficient than other methods.",

In study 1, findings indicated that, relative to two earlier reviews of father participation from 1984 to 1991 and 1992–2004, there has been limited progress in the inclusion of fathers in child psychopathology research over the last decade. In study 2, without explicit efforts to recruit fathers, almost 40% of a sample of 564 parents recruited from online crowdsourcing (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk) were fathers. Major demographic differences did not emerge between mother and father participants and data were equally reliable for mothers and fathers. Fathers were more likely to drop out over the course of a 12-month follow-up but these differences in retention between mothers and fathers were non-significant if fathers were retained at a 2-week follow-up. Finally, family process models tested across four assessments (baseline, 4, 8, and 12 month follow-ups) indicated that data from fathers are equally supportive of convergent validity as data from mothers. We concluded that online crowdsourcing is a promising recruitment methodology to increase father participation in child psychopathology research.",

Following observations of ethics and public reactions to media, we propose that fictional contexts, such as reality, imagination, and virtual environments, will mitigate people’s moral condemnation of harm violations, more so than purity violations. That is, imagining a purely harmful act is given a “fictive pass,” in moral judgment, whereas imagining an abnormal act involving the body is evaluated more negatively because it is seen as more diagnostic of bad character. For Experiment 1, an undergraduate sample (N = 250) evaluated 9 vignettes depicting an agent committing either violations of harm or purity in real life, watching them in films, or imagining them. For Experiments 2 and 3, online participants (N = 375 and N = 321, respectively) evaluated a single vignette depicting an agent committing a violation of harm or purity that either occurred in real life, was imagined, watched in a film, or performed in a video game. Experiment 4 (N = 348) used an analysis of moderated mediation to demonstrate that the perceived wrongness of fictional purity violations is explained both by the extent to which they are seen as a cue to, and a cause of, a poor moral character. Lastly, Experiment 5 (N = 484) validated our manipulations and included the presumption of desire as an additional mediator of the fictive pass asymmetry effects. We discuss implications for moral theories of act and character, anger and disgust, and for media use and regulation.",

In this paper, we attempt to resolve this debate by examining racial resentment’s role in shaping white opinion on a “racialized” policy issue that involves no federal action and no government redistribution of resources: “pay for play” in college athletics. Using cross-sectional and experimental data from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we find evidence not only that racial resentment items tap racial predispositions but also that whites rely on these predispositions when forming and expressing their views on paying college athletes. More specifically, we demonstrate that racially resentful whites who were subtly primed to think about African Americans are more likely to express opposition to paying college athletes when compared with similarly resentful whites who were primed to think about whites. Because free-market conservatism, resistance to changes in the status quo, opposition to expanding federal power, and reluctance to endorse government redistributive policies cannot possibly explain these results, we conclude that racial resentment is a valid measure of antiblack prejudice.",

In four correlational studies, we assessed nostalgia proneness, empathy, motivation to control prejudiced reactions, and blatant as well as subtle prejudice expression. The more prone to nostalgia participants were, the more likely they were to be motivated to control prejudice against an outgroup (African-Americans; Studies 1–4). Further, motivation to control prejudice mediated the relation between nostalgia proneness and reduced blatant/subtle prejudice expression (Studies 2–4). Finally, the stronger motivation to control prejudice and subsequent prejudice expression reduction was mediated by empathy that accompanied higher levels of nostalgia proneness (Studies 3–4). Nostalgia has implications for intergroup perception, and specifically prejudicial attitudes.",

A between-subjects experiment compared the performance of participants who engaged in just learning, just contributing, or a combination. Participants in the learning condition scored highest on a summative test. Participants in both the contribution and combined conditions generated novel, useful questions; there was not a significant difference between the two. Though participants in the combined condition both learned and contributed, this setting did not exhibit an additive benefit, such as better learning in the combined condition. These results highlight the promise and difficulty of double-bottom-line learning experiences.",

Young",Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,January,January 2017,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096516302697,"Previous work shows that children view group membership and psychological traits in essentialist terms, perceiving them to be both biologically determined and stable across time. To what extent might individuals view mental states such as beliefs similarly? Given that beliefs are often based on experience and can change across time, one hypothesis is that beliefs on the whole do not elicit essentialism. An alternative hypothesis, however, is that some beliefs may be perceived as inherited and stable over time—characteristics associated with essentialism. In three studies, we examined two aspects of psychological essentialism regarding three different types of beliefs (religious beliefs, factual beliefs, and opinions) in 8- to 10-year-old children and adults, asking whether beliefs are seen as (a) biologically based and/or (b) stable across time. Both children and adults distinguished among belief types when considering biology; opinions were perceived to be more rooted in biology than were other beliefs. By contrast, fewer consistent differences emerged when children and adults considered stability. For example, both children and adults perceived opinions and factual beliefs to be equally changeable. Finally, although children typically perceived beliefs to be more rooted in biology than adults, more specific patterns across belief types (e.g., perceiving opinions to be more rooted in biology than religious beliefs) remained relatively stable across age groups. Thus, development and social learning may play a larger role in perceptions of the biological component of essentialism than in judgments of particular beliefs. We discuss implications for literatures on essentialism, religious cognition, and social cognitive development.",

Human rights frames are thought to be an especially potent form of rhetorical communication because human rights are thought to trump other objectives. However, the proliferation of rights-based claims could potentially be counter-productive if overused, as rights may come in to conflict or devalue the concept. Advocates have sought to frame a variety of global health concerns as human rights, but the rights discourse is more contested for social and economic rights than it is for civil and political rights. There has been some research suggesting that efforts to frame access to antiretroviral AIDS drugs as a human right were successful. However, it remains an open question the extent to which a human rights frame is more persuasive than normative, moral rhetoric and whether a human rights frame, when applied to global health issues, resonates equally in different national contexts. This article provides an overview of arguments for and against the potential utility of a human rights frame as an advocacy strategy in access to health campaigns. The article also provides some preliminary experimental evidence from several surveys from the United States and India, in which access to medicines campaigns framed in moral terms were equally compelling as a campaign framed in terms of health as a human right.",

To optimize the efficacy of programs aiming to prevent exposure to ECs, it is necessary to investigate parental factors that influence behavioral change. This study presents a measure developed to assess parental self-efficacy (PSE) for preventing children from being exposed to ECs, the PSE for Contaminant Exposure Prevention (PSE-CEP). Methods: The PSE-CEP was administered to parents of children under six drawn from a low-income preschool (n = 210) and an on-line polling website (n = 377). An exploratory factor analysis was conducted, convergent and discriminant validity were assessed, and the relation of the measure to demographic and parenting characteristics were examined. Results: Based on model fit indices, a four-factor model was the best fit. Factors represented confidence in prevention using cleaning, medical care, children’s physical environment, and meal time. All factors of the PSE-CEP demonstrated good reliability and construct validity and were related to more optimal parenting characteristics. Conclusion: A measure of this type will allow interventions to be tailored based on parents’ self-efficacy to more appropriately support them in taking steps to create healthier environments for their children.",

Rule",Journal of Nonverbal Behavior,January,January 2017,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-016-0248-6,"Interpersonal accuracy correlates modestly across different domains. Although some research has explored factors that predict accuracy within specific domains of interpersonal judgment (e.g., social attributes), whether any variables might predict interpersonal accuracy generally across different domains remains in question. Subjective socioeconomic status (SES) has recently emerged as an important moderator of various social cognitions, such as contextual focus and empathic accuracy. Moreover, people lower in SES tend to show greater interpersonal engagement and attention; thus, we wondered whether individuals with lower subjective SES might exhibit superior interpersonal accuracy in multiple domains. Indeed, across four studies, we found that subjective SES inversely correlated with accuracy in three different domains of interpersonal accuracy: social attributes, situational affect, and emotion. These findings therefore demonstrate that subjective SES may predict broad interpersonal accuracy abilities and suggest that, despite modest relationships between different types of first impression accuracy, the correlates of such accuracy can still operate across domains.",

Specifically, we compared spank, swat, slap, hit, and beat. We hypothesized that (a) parents and nonparents would rate these terms differently, (b) corporal terms would be differentiated in a consistent manner across 3 behavior rating scales (common, acceptable, effective), and (c) acceptable and effective ratings would align more closely to each other than either would to common ratings. Method: In an online survey, participants read 8 vignettes with words used to label parental reactions to child misbehaviors and rated each vignette on how common, acceptable, and effective the response was. Results: Parents rated corporal actions as more common than did nonparents, but the samples were comparable on acceptable and effective ratings. Rank order of corporal term ratings was consistent across rating scales, with spank rated as the most common, acceptable, and effective response, followed (in order) by swat, hit, slap, and beat. Finally, evaluations of corporal terms on the acceptability and effectiveness of parental responses were more closely aligned with each other than either was to evaluations of how common the responses are. Conclusion: The specific verbs used to describe acts of physical discipline can alter interpretations of the associated behavior, and potentially serve to normalize, conceal, or justify violent actions.",

From an exchange market point of view, the pricing and task allocation in such a unified system depend only on the supply and demand since no one can dominate the process, with the optimal solution being characterized by the Walrasian Equilibrium. This is quite different from existing approaches, where each task initiator builds a specific mobile crowdsensing (MCS) system and provides an incentive mechanism to maximize his/her own utility. We design distributed algorithms to compute the Walrasian Equilibrium under the scenario where one cloud platform is available in the system. We propose to maximize social welfare of the whole system, and dual decomposition is then employed to divide the social welfare maximization problem into a set of subproblems that can be solved by task initiators and mobile users. We prove that the pro- posed algorithm converges to the optimal solution of social welfare maximization problem. Further, we show that the prices and task allocation obtained by the algorithm also yields a Walrasian Equilibrium. Also, the proposed algo- rithm does not need the cloud to collect private information such as utility functions of task initiators and cost functions of mobile users. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

While studies of policy support often emphasize direct effects on personal welfare, for many regulatory policies – like financial regulations – direct effect models yield unclear predictions while indirect policy effects – such as a policy’s interdependent effect on reciprocal foreign policies or on the global economic network as a whole – are more clear. We examine how citizens respond to distinct logics about policy externalities. An original survey experiment compares support toward financial regulations when respondents receive different arguments – direct, interdependent, or network – about the policy’s positive effects. Respondents consistently and most strongly supported regulations when provided with the network logic argument. This argument increased support even among respondents least likely to support regulations (e.g. conservatives). Interdependence arguments did not significantly increase support. We also identified theoretical sources of heterogeneity across citizens and find some evidence that folk realism moderates the degree to which respondents believe the interdependent argument’s causal chain. We found little evidence that respondents’ degrees of ethnocentrism moderates the effects. Our results suggest that interdependent and networked perspectives toward the structure of the global economy represent a promising avenue to further understand public preferences over economic policies.",

The emphasis of the LNK task in 2016 is on multimodality as used by videomakers to communicate their intended message. Crowdsourcing makes three critical contributions to the LNK task. First, it allows us to verify the multimodal nature of the anchors (queries) used in the task. Second, it enables us to evaluate the performance of video-to-video linking systems at large scale. Third, it gives us insights into how people understand the relevance relationship between two linked video segments. These insights are valuable since the relationship between video segments can manifest itself at different levels of abstraction.",

Many mechanisms and tools are proposed to detect and mitigate privacy leaks. However, they rarely consider users’ preferences and expectations. Users hold various expectation towards different mobile apps. For example, users may allow a social app to access their photos rather than a game app because it goes beyond users’ expectation to access personal photos. Therefore, we believe it is practical and beneficial to understand users’ privacy expectations on various mobile apps and help them mitigate privacy risks introduced by smartphones. To achieve this objective, we propose and implement PriWe, a system based on crowdsourcing driven by users who contribute privacy permission settings of the apps installed on their smartphones. PriWe leverages the crowdsourced permission settings to understand users’ privacy expectations and provides app specific recommendations to mitigate information leakage. We deployed PriWe in the real world for evaluation. According to the feedback of 78 users who evaluated our system and 422 participants who completed our survey, PriWe is able to make proper recommendations which can match participants’ privacy expectations and are mostly accepted by users, thereby help them to mitigate privacy disclosure in smartphones.",

Starting from a given set of video segments, called anchors, a set of related segments, called targets, must be provided. In past years, a number of content-based approaches have been proposed with good results obtained by searching for target segments that are very similar to the anchor in terms of content and information. Unfortunately, relevance has been obtained to the expense of diversity. In this paper, we study multimodal approaches and their ability to provide a set of diverse yet relevant targets. We compare two recently introduced cross-modal approaches, namely, deep auto-encoders and bimodal LDA, and experimentally show that both provide significantly more diverse targets than a state-of-the-art baseline. Bimodal autoencoders offer the best trade-off between relevance and diversity, with bimodal LDA exhibiting slightly more diverse targets at a lower precision.",

Furthermore, an automatic image tagging and caption generation API is compared to manually set image and caption signals. We show and discuss the difficulty to find the correct gist especially for abstract, non-depictable gists as well as the impact of different types of signals on gist detection quality.",

Top-down factors (e.g., stereotypes), however, affect categorizations, suggesting racial prototypicality may enhance category competition in certain perceivers. Here, we examined how prejudice affects race category competition and stabilization when perceiving faces varying in racial prototypicality. Prototypically low versus high Black relative to White faces elicited more category competition and slower response latencies during categorization (Experiment 1), suggesting a pronounced racial prototypicality effect on minority race categorization. However, prejudice predicted the extent of category competition between prototypically low versus high Black faces. Suggesting more response conflict toward less prototypic Black versus White faces, anterior cingulate cortex activity increased toward Black versus White faces as they decreased in racial prototypicality, with prejudice positively predicting this difference (Experiment 2). These findings extend the literature on racial prototypicality and categorization by showing that relative prejudice tempers the extent of category competition and response conflict engaged when initially perceiving faces.",

Results suggest that consumers demonstrate more favorable responses when a company launches a CSR initiative congruent with the crisis issue, or when the crisis is the result of an accident rather than a transgression. Further, the congruence between the crisis issue and the pre-crisis CSR initiative moderates the consistency effects between pre- and post-crisis initiatives. Such findings should be understood by considering the mediating role of corporate CSR motives’ consumer attributions, which was evidenced in this study. This study theoretically contributes to an improved understanding of the underlying mechanism of the post-crisis CSR information process and managerially contributes to the strategic development of effective post-crisis CSR initiatives given a particular situation.",
